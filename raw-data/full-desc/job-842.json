    "description": "<p>Whether you&#39;re on a consumer product (like Gmail, Search, Maps, Chrome, Android) or a business product (Google Ads, AdSense, Google Marketing Platform, Analytics), you take part in a complete marketing experience as you lead every facet of the product&#39;s journey. From determining positioning, naming, feature prioritization and external communications, you help shape the voice of the product and help it grow a loyal consumer base. This means you work with a cross-functional team across sales, corporate communications, legal, webmasters, product development, engineering and more. In this role, you&#39;ll be involved with product marketing strategy from beginning to end.</p>\n\n\n<p>As a Customer Insights Lead at Google, you&#39;ll develop and implement research studies that provide foundational learning to inform business/product strategy, product development, as well as insights/measurement to inform and measure Go-to-Market (GtM) strategy and campaigns. Additionally, you&#39;ll drive our customer insight efforts across the customer journey. This role is central to the company\u2019s Product, Marketing, and Sales efforts.</p><p>Know the user. Know the magic. Connect the two. At its core, marketing at Google starts with technology and ends with the user, bringing both together in unconventional ways. Our job is to demonstrate how Google&#39;s products solve the world&#39;s problems--from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can--changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.</p>",
