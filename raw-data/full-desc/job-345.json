Every day is a new challenge, and you&#39;re continually looking for ways to help our team get better at what we do, in the most efficient way possible. A team player at heart, you collaborate with our global team, advocate best practices and roll up your sleeves to pitch in when it&#39;s all hands on deck. You move fast while keeping your attention to detail, and you tap into your problem-solving skills to support Google&#39;s business objectives.</p>\n\n\n<p>The Platforms and Ecosystems Risk Management and Compliance team helps Google to manage commercial agreement and spend governance and the diverse universe of risks associated with these commitments. You will manage agreement and spend review committee reviews of important, high-value commitments, and ensure that Google&#39;s agreement and spend governance policies and processes are effective, efficient, and accountable.</p><p>The name Google came from &quot;googol,&quot; a mathematical term for the number 1 followed by 100 zeros.
