    "description": "<p>Our Googlers are innovative, take big risks and get things done, and our compensation plans are designed to reward them accordingly. On the leading edge of the compensation field, our team runs cyclical cash and equity programs and takes the notion of &quot;Total Rewards&quot;\u009d to new heights. We always aim to better recognize outstanding performance, so as a member of this team, you&#39;re an unconventional thinker and are willing to make bold bets. You take Googlers&#39; feedback seriously, and collect it often to continually improve and enhance our programs through a two-way dialogue. Combining data and feedback from our Googlers with the latest industry research, you make large-scale, data-driven decisions that impact Googlers in a meaningful way.</p>\n\n\n<p>As a Compensation Design Analyst, you will use your analytical skills to ensure that we attract and retain the world\u2019s best talent by paying Googlers fairly and maximizing the value of our compensation spend. This will require you to think big -- designing innovative programs that support our philosophy, while advocating for strong governance. You will work on salary, bonus and equity compensation design, reviewing data and developing models to create our algorithms, budgets and policies. You\u2019ll identify new ways to use data, and combine both feedback from Googlers and the latest industry research to make large-scale, data-driven decisions.</p><p>Great just isn&#39;t good enough for our People Operations team (you probably know us better as &quot;\u0098Human Resources&quot;). Made up of equal parts HR professionals, former consultants and analysts, we&#39;re the advocates of Google&#39;s colorful culture. In People Ops, we &quot;find them, grow them, and keep them&quot;\u009d - we bring the world&#39;s most innovative people to Google and provide the programs that help them thrive. Whether recruiting the next great Googler, refining our core programs, developing talent or simply looking for ways to inject some more fun into the lives of our Googlers, we bring a data-driven approach that is reinventing the human resources field.</p>",
