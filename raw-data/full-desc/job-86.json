Whether you are making our staffing systems more efficient, planning for our growth, building relationships on college campuses or cultivating the next generation of computer scientists, you have an eye on the staffing needs of Google and the broader hiring landscape. You are focused on cultivating outstanding candidates for Google&#39;s long-term hiring needs, and work across a cross-functional and international group of staffing teams. You are both scrappy and resourceful, creative and driven -- and excited to share the magic of working at Google.<br><br>As a manager, you support team members to exercise independent thinking and make rapid progress towards goals. Working closely with your team to deliver results, you remove roadblocks and ensure that projects and tasks are appropriately resourced.</p>\n\n<p>Intern Programs team aims to build a strong, diverse pipeline of student talent for Google for full time hires. We strive to be the top internship programs globally for identifying, engaging, developing and recruiting the world\u2019s best student talent. We&#39;re experiencing tremendous momentum as we hire for, plan and execute innovative programs that develop talented students and future Googlers at unprecedented scale.\n</p>\n\n<p>As a Lead, you will manage a team of Recruiters responsible for recruiting interns for our Building Opportunities for Leadership &amp; Development (BOLD) internship program. You will contribute to Google&#39;s growth by creating a strategy to identify our full-time candidate pipeline through internships in our Global Business and General &amp; Administrative functions. You will be responsible for creating a streamlined intern recruiting and intern conversion recruiting process. You will partner closely with our University Programs, Student Development and Entry-level Recruiting teams to determine the most relevant intern outreach and hiring efforts based on the company&#39;s short-term and long-term hiring needs. You will partner with groups from inside and outside the Intern Programs teams to develop, support, and improve our intern recruiting processes, candidate experience and client management.</p><p>Great just isn&#39;t good enough for our People Operations team (you probably know us better as &quot;\u0098Human Resources&quot;). Made up of equal parts HR professionals, former consultants and analysts, we&#39;re the advocates of Google&#39;s colorful culture. In People Ops, we &quot;find them, grow them, and keep them&quot;\u009d - we bring the world&#39;s most innovative people to Google and provide the programs that help them thrive. Whether recruiting the next great Googler, refining our core programs, developing talent or simply looking for ways to inject some more fun into the lives of our Googlers, we bring a data-driven approach that is reinventing the human resources field.</p>",
