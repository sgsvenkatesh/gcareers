    "description": "<p>Finance Project Managers drive critical priorities for Google by leading and assisting in projects of all sizes. Drawing from your strong financial background, you work with a diverse team to manage projects from concept to implementation and keep Google-wide stakeholders informed as you go. You get down into the details of complex analyses without losing sight of the overall objective. When working on multiple projects at once, you intuitively know which issues to highlight and can bring key decision makers together to come up with effective solutions. Once a project is completed, you&#39;re able to clearly communicate the results and draw the key learnings for senior management. You are efficient and organized, making the most of everyone&#39;s abilities and holding the team to a high standard.</p>\n\n\n<p>Our team&#39;s goal is to support Alphabet and other Bet Finance by accelerating the achievement of their strategic priorities, solving their toughest problems, and building out a skillset across the organization.\n</p>\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re looking for exceptional Project Managers to join the Alphabet Finance Program Management Office (PMO). Your job will be to structure projects with your stakeholders, define project goals and risks to execution, gather and define comprehensive requirements, design new business processes, effective change management to deliver on planned benefits, and usher projects through the entire project lifecycle. You will use your understanding of finance to guide decision-making, solve problems, and provide analytical insight and business judgment to support strategic and tactical initiatives across the Alphabet organization.</p><p>The name Google came from &quot;googol,&quot; a mathematical term for the number 1 followed by 100 zeros. And nobody at Google loves big numbers like the Finance team when providing in depth analysis on all manner of strategic decisions across Google products. From developing forward-thinking analysis to generating management reports to scaling our automated financial processes, the Finance organization is an important partner and advisor to the business.</p>",
