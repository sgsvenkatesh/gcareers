    "description": "<p>Our computational challenges are so big, complex and unique we can&#39;t just purchase off-the-shelf hardware, we&#39;ve got to make it ourselves. Your team designs and builds the hardware, software and networking technologies that power all of Google&#39;s services. As a RF Desense Engineer, you design and build the systems that are the heart of the world&#39;s largest and most powerful computing infrastructure. You develop from the lowest levels of circuit design to large system design and see those systems all the way through to high volume manufacturing. Your work has the potential to shape the machinery that goes into our cutting-edge data centers affecting millions of Google users. <br><br>With your technical expertise, you lead projects in multiple areas of expertise (i.e., engineering domains or systems) within a data center facility, including construction and equipment installation/troubleshooting/debugging with vendors.</p>\n\n\n<p>As a RF Desense Engineer, you&#39;ll be responsible for achieving RF system-level performance by performing RF desense simulation and design, architecting RF desense validation systems, planning test flow, and defining a test matrix with thorough coverage.\n</p>\n\n\n<p>You have a RF design and verification background and knowledge of overall system architecture of wireless mobile products.\n</p>\n\n\n<p>You will work cross-functionally with Electrical Engineering Designers, RF Engineers, Antenna Engineers, Product Designers, CAD designers, Software Engineers, Compliance Engineers, and ATE Engineers to validate, improve, and deliver products from concept to production, as well as product sustaining.\n</p>\n\n\n<p>You will train Hardware Test Engineers/Technicians in verification tests, review results and communicate with the cross-functional team to ensure the best quality of the product is achieved.</p><p>Google&#39;s mission is to organize the world&#39;s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Our Hardware team researches, designs, and develops new technologies and hardware to make our user&#39;s interaction with computing faster, more powerful, and seamless. Whether finding new ways to capture and sense the world around us, advancing form factors, or improving interaction methods, our Hardware team is making people&#39;s lives better through technology.</p>",
