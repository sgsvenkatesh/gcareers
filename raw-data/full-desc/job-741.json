As a member of this team, you know your accounting principles and the full accounting process end to end. You&#39;ll advise on financial reports required by governmental regulations, and you&#39;ll review, analyze, and interpret financial and budgetary reports -- and all this sounds like fun to you. Every day is a new challenge, and you&#39;re continually looking for ways to help our team get better at what we do, in the most efficient way possible. A team player at heart, you collaborate with our global team, advocate best practices and roll up your sleeves to pitch in when it&#39;s all hands on deck. You move fast while keeping your attention to detail, and you tap into your problem-solving skills to support Google&#39;s business objectives.</p>\n\n<p>As a Senior Accountant, you will support the Google Corporate Accounting organization. You will assist with Accounting Close and Consolidations process, system implementations, improvements, and maintenance as needed. Your experience in Accounting and Systems will be called for to work with cross-functional teams to define, build, and rollout innovative technology and business process solutions to increase efficiencies, reduce cost, improve customer satisfaction, and drive consistent processes. You will play a vital role in the Accounting team as we redefine our processes and systems. You will interface with business teams to assist in gathering and understanding their requirements, flow out the \u2018as is\u2019 and &#39;desired state&#39; business and process flows, dig into the details to understand the problem, coordinate requirements discussions, document requirements, and act as the liaison between the various business and technical teams.</p><p>The name Google came from &quot;googol,&quot; a mathematical term for the number 1 followed by 100 zeros. And nobody at Google loves big numbers like the Finance team when providing in depth analysis on all manner of strategic decisions across Google products. From developing forward-thinking analysis to generating management reports to scaling our automated financial processes, the Finance organization is an important partner and advisor to the business.</p>",
