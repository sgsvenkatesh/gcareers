As a CMF Designer, you leverage your strong technical background and understanding of &quot;good&quot;\u009d design to look for ways to streamline the user experience. You work closely with the product managers and development engineers throughout the entire production cycle. You design everything from high-level product flow to detailed UI mockups and then use your expert scripting skills to make your designs a reality.</p>\n\n<p>As a member of the Industrial Design team, you&#39;ll identify high-level macro trends as a basis for creating moods and stories, develop color strategies, and execute the final color and material on products at factories around the world. Your process demonstrates unique and innovative solutions that push boundaries, yet are producible with high-levels of quality. You&#39;ll conceptually develop a range of colors and materials that will be used as samples to target in production with our vendors.\n</p>\n\n<p>As a CMF Designer, you will work across categories within the Google Hardware portfolio. In this role, you&#39;ll use your knowledge and collaborative skills to take a design vision to market and commercialize at scale. You have a keen eye for color and attention to detail, understand trends and have a pulse on industry trends.\n</p>\n\n<p>Please include a URL for an online portfolio showing a sense of CMF applied to a variety of product categories, including examples that demonstrate the story and rationale.</p><p>Google&#39;s mission is to organize the world&#39;s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Our Hardware team researches, designs, and develops new technologies and hardware to make our user&#39;s interaction with computing faster, more powerful, and seamless. Whether finding new ways to capture and sense the world around us, advancing form factors, or improving interaction methods, our Hardware team is making people&#39;s lives better through technology.</p>",
