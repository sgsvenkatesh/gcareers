    "description": "<p>Google&#39;s projects, like our users, span the globe and require managers to keep the big picture in focus while being able to dive into the unique engineering challenges we face daily. As a Technical Program Manager at Google, you lead complex, multi-disciplinary engineering projects using your engineering expertise. You plan requirements with internal customers and usher projects through the entire project lifecycle. This includes managing project schedules, identifying risks and clearly communicating them to project stakeholders. You&#39;re equally at home explaining your team&#39;s analyses and recommendations to executives as you are discussing the technical trade-offs in product development with engineers.</p>\n\n<p>At the core of Google Assistant\u2019s mission is the aim of successfully establishing a platform (Actions on Google) for third-party and first-party app developers to build high-quality experiences for the Google Assistant.</p>\n\n<p>You are self-motivated, a creative technical problem solver who likes creating order out of chaos. You can also navigate ambiguity and have a passion for driving complex engineering projects to completion.</p>\n\n<p>We build products in a dynamic, fast-paced environment, and we expect that you can thrive in these environments, ask tough questions, keep things on track and be part of an awesome team.</p><p>There is always more information out there, and the Research and Machine Intelligence team has a never-ending quest to find it and make it accessible. We&#39;re constantly refining our signature search engine to provide better results, and developing offerings like Google Instant, Google Voice Search and Google Image Search to make it faster and more engaging. We&#39;re providing users around the world with great search results every day, but at Google, great just isn&#39;t good enough. We&#39;re just getting started.</p>",
