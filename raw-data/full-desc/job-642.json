    "description": "<p>Our computational challenges are so big, complex and unique we can&#39;t just purchase off-the-shelf hardware, we&#39;ve got to make it ourselves. Your team designs and builds the hardware, software and networking technologies that power all of Google&#39;s services. As a Hardware Engineer, you design and build the systems that are the heart of the world&#39;s largest and most powerful computing infrastructure. You develop from the lowest levels of circuit design to large system design and see those systems all the way through to high volume manufacturing. Your work has the potential to shape the machinery that goes into our cutting-edge data centers affecting millions of Google users.<br><br>Pulling on your technical and leadership expertise, you lead end-to-end research projects in multiple areas of expertise across data center facilities and manage a team of direct reports working on equipment installation, troubleshooting and debugging.</p>\n\n<p>As a Foundry and Product Engineering Lead, you will be part of Google\u2019s Consumer Hardware Silicon team, developing high performance and low power hardware to enable Google\u2019s continuous innovations in the mobile space. You will be responsible for releasing SoC/ASIC/PMIC ICs into high volume production for consumer and mobile devices. You will work with ATE, DFT, Analog Design, Digital Design, Silicon Validation, and Reliability teams to create characterization and qualification plans.\n</p>\n\n<p>In this role, you will set process technology road-maps, perform technical evaluations of IP and process technology vendors, and provide recommendations. Additionally, you will work with architects and logic designers to drive PDK feasibility studies, develop design goals, and explore design/process trade-offs for physical design closure.</p><p>Google&#39;s mission is to organize the world&#39;s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Our Hardware team researches, designs, and develops new technologies and hardware to make our user&#39;s interaction with computing faster, more powerful, and seamless. Whether finding new ways to capture and sense the world around us, advancing form factors, or improving interaction methods, our Hardware team is making people&#39;s lives better through technology.</p>",
