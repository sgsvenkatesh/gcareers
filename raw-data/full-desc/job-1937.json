    "description": "<p>As Google drives toward audacious goals, we rely on our SEC Reporting and Technical Accounting team to know exactly what that growth looks like. Each month, quarter and year end, the team prepares the release of Google&#39;s financial statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the public. Through your relationships with various internal sources, you efficiently gather financial information and oversee the process of preparing, reviewing, submitting and distributing the financial reports. But this role calls for more than just knowing the books -- you also provide equity and treasury research and analysis and review necessary statutory reports. You give expert advice to senior management on U.S. GAAP and SEC filings, and work closely with the Investor Relations team on sales and earnings press releases and reports that reach securities analysts, investors and industry groups globally.</p>\n\n\n<p>Google accountants handle the core accounting responsibilities at Google. As a member of this team, you know your accounting principles and the full accounting process end to end. You&#39;ll advise on financial reports required by governmental regulations, and you&#39;ll review, analyze and interpret financial and budgetary reports. Every day is a new challenge, and you&#39;re continually looking for ways to help our team get better at what we do, in the most efficient way possible. A team player at heart, you&#39;ll collaborate with our global team, advocate best practices and roll up your sleeves to pitch in when it&#39;s all hands on deck. You move fast while keeping your attention to detail and you tap into your problem-solving skills to support Google&#39;s business objectives.</p><p>The name Google came from &quot;googol,&quot; a mathematical term for the number 1 followed by 100 zeros. And nobody at Google loves big numbers like the Finance team when providing in depth analysis on all manner of strategic decisions across Google products. From developing forward-thinking analysis to generating management reports to scaling our automated financial processes, the Finance organization is an important partner and advisor to the business.</p>",
