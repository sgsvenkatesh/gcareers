    "description": "<p>Google&#39;s custom-designed machines make up one of the largest and most powerful computing infrastructures in the world. The Hardware Testing Engineering team ensures that this cutting-edge equipment is reliable. In the R&amp;D lab, you design test equipment for prototypes of our machinery and develop the protocols used to scale these tests for the entire global team. Working closely with design engineers, you give input on designs to improve our hardware until you&#39;re sure it meets Google&#39;s standards of quality and reliability.<br><br>With your technical expertise, you create test plans for highly complex platforms (e.g., validating the interaction of multiple pieces of equipment at the networking and subsystem levels), and using your deep knowledge of component design characteristics, you diagnose highly complex hardware or software issues.</p>\n\n<p>As a Hardware System Validation Engineer, you will be responsible for the overall system validation for Google&#39;s consumer hardware products. You have an electrical engineering background and knowledge of multiple low level areas of consumer electronics. You will help define and execute tests for high-speed interfaces, power subsystems, RF circuits, EMC/ESD compliance etc. You&#39;ll also work cross-functionally with Circuit Designers, Technology Experts, Contract Manufacturers, and Software, Mechanical and Compliance teams to deliver devices to production.</p><p>Google&#39;s mission is to organize the world&#39;s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Only one thing consistently stands in the way between our users and the world&#39;s information\u2014hardware. Our Consumer Hardware team researches, designs, and develops new technologies and hardware to make our user&#39;s interaction with computing faster, more powerful, and seamless. Whether finding new ways to capture and sense the world around us, advancing form factors, or improving interaction methods, our Consumer Hardware team is making people&#39;s lives better through technology.</p>",
