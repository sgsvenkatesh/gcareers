And nobody at Google loves big numbers like the Finance team when providing in-depth analysis on all manner of strategic decisions across Google products. From developing forward-thinking analysis to generating management reports to scaling our automated financial processes, the Finance organization is an important partner and advisor to teams across the company.</p><p>Behind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technical Infrastructure team. From developing and maintaining our data centers to building the next generation of Google platforms, we make Google&#39;s product portfolio possible. As Lead Program Manager of Finance Systems, you will partner with Finance Business teams to execute a multi-year systems roadmap. You will drive a multi-year transformation effort to automate business processes and tools, and enable capabilities to strengthen finance reporting. You will work closely with the Finance Leadership team to address areas of opportunity and risks, as well as partner with teams in Corporate Engineering and the business to ensure clear, consistent coordination and timely execution.</p><p>Google&#39;s projects, like our users, span the globe and require managers to keep the big picture in focus. You plan requirements with internal customers and usher projects through the entire project lifecycle. This includes managing project schedules, identifying risks and clearly communicating goals to project stakeholders. Your projects often span offices, time zones and hemispheres, and it&#39;s your job to keep all the players coordinated on the project&#39;s progress and deadlines.</p>",
