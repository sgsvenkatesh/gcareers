    "description": "<p>Design and user experience (UX) are at the forefront of everything we do. The job of an Interaction Designer is to envision how people experience our products and bring that vision to life in a way that feels inspired, refined and even magical. In an Interaction Designer role, you\u2019ll take on complex tasks and transform them into intuitive, accessible and easy-to-use designs for billions of people around the world\u2014from the first-time user to the sophisticated expert. Achieving this goal requires collaboration with teams of Designers, Researchers, Engineers and Product Managers throughout the design process\u2014from creating user flows and wireframes to building user interface mockups and prototypes. At each stage, you will anticipate what our users need, advocate for them and ensure that the final product surprises and delights them.</p>\n\n<p>Voice interfaces are ideal for children and users with accessibility issues, while also enabling new means of interacting with digital systems in a more personal and conversational way. They present many vast opportunities while also posing unique challenges in which we must consider safety, social context, and discoverability. In this role, you will be in a unique position which focuses on voice-only interfaces, rather than screen or multi-modal situations. You&#39;ll cover areas as diverse as Home Entertainment, Automation and Security, Automotive and Wearables.</p><p>User experience (UX) is at the forefront of how we create intuitive, innovative, and beautiful products that people love. We strive to learn and understand our users\u2019 needs, behaviors, and emotions to yield insights that inform product strategy and guide the design of the experiences we create. Our multidisciplinary UX teams include designers, researchers, content strategists, and engineers who are passionate about quality, usability, and performance. We collaborate closely with product managers, software engineers, and many others to solve complex challenges and craft powerful experiences that highlight our products\u2019 unique capabilities and personalities. Our work touches billions while exemplifying a key principle that is core to Google\u2019s philosophy: \u201cFocus on the user and all else will follow.\u201d</p>",
