Guiding your team&#39;s search for how to bring innovation and fresh thinking to retail environments is the question: &quot;What if Google was a place?&quot;. You may be responsible for managing retail executions, both online and offline, for Google products such as Pixel, Google Home, Google wearables and more. Regularly, you provide guidance to retail partners on how to best bring Google ecosystems to life in retail environments.<br></p>\n\n<p>As the Retail Partner Marketing Manager for US Carriers, you will be lead the retail marketing partnerships for Made by Google products in the mobility and carrier space.

Our job is to demonstrate how Google&#39;s products solve the world&#39;s problems--from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can--changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.</p>",
