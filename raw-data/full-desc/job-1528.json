    "description": "<p>Google&#39;s software engineers develop the next-generation technologies that change how billions of users connect, explore, and interact with information and one another. Our products need to handle information at massive scale, and extend well beyond web search. We&#39;re looking for engineers who bring fresh ideas from all areas, including information retrieval, distributed computing, large-scale system design, networking and data storage, security, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, UI design and mobile; the list goes on and is growing every day. As a software engineer, you will work on a specific project critical to Google\u2019s needs with opportunities to switch teams and projects as you and our fast-paced business grow and evolve. We need our engineers to be versatile, display leadership qualities and be enthusiastic to handle new problems across the full-stack as we continue to push technology forward.<br><br>With your technical expertise you manage individual projects priorities, deadlines and deliverables. You design, develop, test, deploy, maintain, and enhance software solutions.</p>\n\n<p>Since its inception, Google has built products that change the way people all over the world live and access information - looking up recipes, finding their favorite song, turn-by-turn directions, checking their email, and so much more. How and where people view this information continues to change as the world becomes an increasingly mobile place.\n</p>\n\n<p>As an Android Applications Software Engineer, you\u2019ll drive new innovations and build beautiful user experiences on the largest mobile platform in the world. You\u2019ll work with world-class mobile developers and resources to drive the next generation of apps at Google. Whether building native applications on Google\u2019s core products and services - Search, Gmail, YouTube - or pioneering new visions - like Android Auto, Android Things, Android Security, Android Platform, Google Now on Tap, Android Wear, Cardboard - you\u2019ll impact people\u2019s lives wherever they interact with our products - in their homes, on the go, or someplace in between! \n</p>\n\n<p>You will develop applications primarily in Java and using the Android SDK. You might design and develop open-source Android applications that are part of the Android Open Source Project or closed-source Google applications that are the interface to Google services on Android.</p><p>Google is and always will be an engineering company. We hire people with a broad set of technical skills who are ready to take on some of technology&#39;s greatest challenges and make an impact on millions, if not billions, of users. At Google, engineers not only revolutionize search, they routinely work on massive scalability and storage solutions, large-scale applications and entirely new platforms for developers around the world. From Google Ads to Chrome, Android to YouTube, Social to Local, Google engineers are changing the world one technological achievement after another.</p>",
