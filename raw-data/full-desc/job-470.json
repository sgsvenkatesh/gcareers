    "description": "<p>Whether you&#39;re on a consumer product (like Gmail, Search, Maps, Chrome, Android) or a business product (Google Ads, AdSense, Google Marketing Platform, Analytics), you take part in a complete marketing experience as you lead every facet of the product&#39;s journey. From determining positioning, naming, competitive analysis, feature prioritization and external communications, you help shape the voice of the product and help it grow a loyal consumer base. This means you work with a cross-functional team across sales, corporate communications, legal, webmasters, product development, engineering and more. In this role, you&#39;ll be involved with product marketing strategy from beginning to end.</p>\n\n<p>As a part of Marketing\u2019s Strategy and Operations team, you will engage regularly with marketing leads/Chief Marketing Officers for product areas to establish Marketing\u2019s strategic direction, getting broad exposure to different parts of the business. You will work with teams and collaborate cross-functionally with key leaders within Marketing and across Product, Finance, and Engineering to solve our toughest challenges, advocate high priority projects, and drive greater operational rigor within Marketing. In this role, you will become an invaluable source of advice and essential partner to Marketing executives. Ideal candidates will have a hypothesis-driven approach to problem solving, strong quantitative skills, comfort tackling broad-reaching and ambiguous questions, and the ability to communicate and work collaboratively and cross-functionally with Googlers of all levels. \n</p>\n\n<p>As an Associate Product Marketing Manager (APMM), you will be part of a unique and highly respected program within the company. The program provides the opportunity to learn new skills through training, an extensive network, international travel to learn more about Google\u2019s business in global markets, and rotations to gain exposure to different products, functions, and/or global locations. Please note this job description is specific to Strategy and Operations and will place you in this role as the first rotation as part of the APMM program. You can find more information about the APMM program on the Google job site here: <a href=\"https://www.google.com/about/careers/students/apmm.html\">g.co/APMMProgram.</a></p><p>Know the user. Know the magic. Connect the two. At its core, marketing at Google starts with technology and ends with the user, bringing both together in unconventional ways. Our job is to demonstrate how Google&#39;s products solve the world&#39;s problems--from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can--changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.</p>",
