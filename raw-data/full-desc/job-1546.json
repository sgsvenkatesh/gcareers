    "description": "<p>Whether you&#39;re on a consumer product (like Gmail, Search, Maps, Chrome, Android) or a business product (Google Ads, AdSense, Google Marketing Platform, Analytics), you take part in a complete marketing experience as you lead every facet of the product&#39;s journey. From determining positioning, naming, competitive analysis, feature prioritization and external communications, you help shape the voice of the product and help it grow a consumer base. This means you work with a cross-functional team across Sales, corporate communications, legal, webmasters, product development, engineering and more. In this role, you&#39;ll be involved with product marketing strategy from beginning to end.</p>\n\n\n<p>As a Product Marketing Manager, you will join a small Android TV marketing team to shape the future of television. From developing product positioning to driving consumer research to evolving brand architecture, you will manage the Android TV platform narrative. In this role, you will bring these narratives to life via Google\u2019s own marketing initiatives and partners\u2019 campaigns. Within Google, you will also work closely with Product, Brand, and Retail Marketing teams and collaboratively as part of a cross-functional team with Go-To-Market and Business Development, Engineering/Product/UX, Corporate Communications, Legal and others.</p><p>Know the user. Know the magic. Connect the two. At its core, marketing at Google starts with technology and ends with the user, bringing both together in unconventional ways. Our job is to demonstrate how Google&#39;s products solve the world&#39;s problems--from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can--changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.</p>",
