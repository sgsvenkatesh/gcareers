    "description": "<p>The Finance Operations team manages Google&#39;s cash transactions on a global basis and ensures that Google&#39;s incoming and outgoing cash processes are controlled, effective and efficient. As a member of this team, you&#39;ll find innovative ways to manage our complex set of transactions. You thrive on making processes more efficient and scalable, you work to ensure the highest level of quality of our operations and you proactively minimize operational risk. Externally, you collaborate with our outsourcing partners and internally, you collaborate across the five areas of the Financial Operations team: Global Revenue Operations, Procure to Pay, Electronic Payment Services, Business Process Outsourcing, and Payroll.</p>\n\n<p>The Revenue Program Management team (RPM) leads cross-functional program management for the billing and payments platform design and improvement projects. This team acts as the key point-of-contact on behalf of all of Finance to triage all the concerns and root challenges, gather requirements, act as the key liaison with the Payments/Products Management and Engineer teams, and work with the cross-finance teams to execute on the projects/programs, including coordination of testing and post-launch operations. Our projects span across Google multiple teams and fall into Tax, Regulatory, Complex Product Launches, Platforms Infrastructure and Migrations and Special projects categories.\n</p>\n\n<p>As a Program Manager, you will apply exceptional leadership, program management, organizational, and communication skills as you engage key stakeholders across Google to prioritize and rationalize platform requirements from Finance, define programs with Product and Engineering teams to deliver new platform capabilities, and ensure smooth and successful launches to support our global accounting and operations teams. High quality launches, collaborative project teams, and happy stakeholders define success for this role.</p><p>The name Google came from &quot;googol,&quot; a mathematical term for the number 1 followed by 100 zeros. And nobody at Google loves big numbers like the Finance team when providing in depth analysis on all manner of strategic decisions across Google products. From developing forward-thinking analysis to generating management reports to scaling our automated financial processes, the Finance organization is an important partner and advisor to the business.</p>",
