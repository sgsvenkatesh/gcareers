    "description": "<p>The Google People Services Operations function is the team that creates amazing experiences for Googlers (and candidates), by running services and program management groups within People Operations, with the ultimate goal of making HR \u2018stuff\u2019 easy and intuitive for Googlers.</p>\n\n<p>Our global team creates world class experiences and people processes, from problem definition to execution. We partner with teams across People Operations and in engineering to bring innovation and technology to the way we attract, retain and grow Googlers worldwide. We focus on providing an amazing experience to past, present and future Googlers, and work in Google\u2019s fast-paced environment to deliver operational services, manage the contingent workforce and implement HR programs across 70+ countries. Regardless of location or level of experience, members of the Operations team have the opportunity to create, develop and implement some of the most complex global operations around the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>You are a dynamic leader who is not afraid to be \u201chands-on\u201d whilst understanding the bigger picture. You will be strong on building experience, understanding HR and using data to drive decisions, and you will be able to demonstrate an affinity with the service and product space that Google owns. You should be able to balance strategic vision, thought leadership, followership, execution excellence, continuous improvement and provide an exceptional experience to Googlers. As the &quot;eyes and ears&quot; for everything that happens, you will need to be able to spot trends and turn them into broader change programs. You will be a member of the global leadership team for the function and for People Operations leadership team in the region and play a role in shaping and delivering on the agenda. Most importantly, you should be able to inspire and grow a remarkable team.\n</p><p>Principal clients of Google People Services (GPS) Operations include the business leaders and their HR partners in all units and functions, and all other People Operations functions. A key priority will be to establish collaboration and partnership among this group. Other priorities will include meeting increasing demand by scaling the organization for growth whilst maintaining high performance and delivery standards.</p><p>Great just isn&#39;t good enough for our People Operations team (you probably know us better as &quot;\u0098Human Resources&quot;). Made up of equal parts HR professionals, former consultants and analysts, we&#39;re the advocates of Google&#39;s colorful culture. In People Ops, we &quot;find them, grow them, and keep them&quot;\u009d - we bring the world&#39;s most innovative people to Google and provide the programs that help them thrive. Whether recruiting the next great Googler, refining our core programs, developing talent or simply looking for ways to inject some more fun into the lives of our Googlers, we bring a data-driven approach that is reinventing the human resources field.</p>",
