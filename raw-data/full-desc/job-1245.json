We are looking for quick-witted, entrepreneurial and intellectually curious people to join the team. To succeed here, you&#39;ll need to be able to combine creativity with the organizational skills to manage numerous different projects to tight deadlines simultaneously, as well as enjoy pitching to all kinds of journalists, bloggers and commentators (we find it hard too!), or producing internal communications and events for our employees. Things happen quickly at Google and to get stuff done here you need to be an enthusiastic team player - a self-starter who can work cross-functionally and isn&#39;t frightened to take risks or try out new ways of doing things.</p>",
