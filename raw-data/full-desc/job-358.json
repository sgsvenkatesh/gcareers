    "description": "<p>Every day, Google provides service to millions of Internet users around the world. We make sure that the network our users rely on always exceeds Google&#39;s high standards. You enable the team to make informed decisions for network expansion and growth. With Google&#39;s ever-evolving technologies at your fingertips, you&#39;ll be challenged to innovate. At the same time, you work to ensure that the future network will accommodate bandwidth and quality needs for Search, video platforms, and more. By directing how and where to cost-effectively expand network infrastructure, you&#39;ll ensure that our users stay connected with our growing suite of applications, products, and services.</p>\n\n\n<p>The Network Demand team within Network Capacity Planning is responsible for the forecasting network bandwidth across Google&#39;s backbone networks and data centers. We are also responsible for understanding risk due to inorganic network demands, and we work with partner teams to develop risk mitigation strategies. We work closely with product managers and product areas to help define internal network products and development teams to implement forecasting algorithms and supply teams to capacity plan the network.</p><p>Behind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technical Infrastructure team to keep it running. From developing and maintaining our data centers to building the next generation of Google platforms, we make Google&#39;s product portfolio possible. We&#39;re proud to be our engineers&#39; engineers and love voiding warranties by taking things apart so we can rebuild them. We&#39;re always on call to keep our networks up and running, ensuring our users have the best and fastest experience possible.</p>",
