    "description": "<p>Google&#39;s projects, like our users, span the globe and require managers to keep the big picture in focus. As a Program Manager at Google, you lead complex, multi-disciplinary projects. You plan requirements with internal customers and usher projects through the entire project lifecycle. This includes managing project schedules, identifying risks and clearly communicating goals to project stakeholders. Your projects often span offices, time zones and hemispheres, and it&#39;s your job to keep all the players coordinated on the project&#39;s progress and deadlines.</p>\n\n\n<p>The Mergers and Acquisitions Technology Integration (MATI) team manages the technical integrations that take place during acquisitions, including corporate infrastructure, business systems, applications, and engineering environments. As Lead Program Manager, you will work across executives and their management teams to cut through bureaucracy to more efficiently run their business and foster cross-organizational partnership. In this role, you will run and manage strategic projects, help run the business cadence (i.e., budgeting, planning, reviews), provide a proxy for your leader, and be able to communicate strategy and decision-making to the management team and other key stakeholders.</p><p>Behind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technical Infrastructure team to keep it running. From developing and maintaining our data centers to building the next generation of Google platforms, we make Google&#39;s product portfolio possible. We&#39;re proud to be our engineers&#39; engineers and love voiding warranties by taking things apart so we can rebuild them. We&#39;re always on call to keep our networks up and running, ensuring our users have the best and fastest experience possible.</p>",
