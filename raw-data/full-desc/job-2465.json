    "description": "<p>Google engineers develop the next-generation technologies that change how users connect, explore, and interact with information and one another. As a member of this team, you develop new products that are used by millions of people. We need our engineers to be versatile and passionate to tackle new challenges as we continue to push technology forward. </p>\n\n<p>As an Imaging and Vision Architect, you will develop novel hardware architectures for hardware-accelerated image and video processing applications. You will work on topics that span areas of image processing, digital imaging, computer vision, computational photography, and machine intelligence. You will optimize algorithms, develop architectural C-models and specify architectures for future generation products. You will also collaborate with Software and SoC Architects to explore, build and test the best hardware architectures to process images and videos for applications including digital photography and machine intelligence.</p><p>Google&#39;s mission is to organize the world&#39;s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Our Hardware team researches, designs, and develops new technologies and hardware to make our user&#39;s interaction with computing faster, more powerful, and seamless. Whether finding new ways to capture and sense the world around us, advancing form factors, or improving interaction methods, our Hardware team is making people&#39;s lives better through technology.</p>",
