    "description": "<p>At Google, User Experience Researchers (UXRs) help everyone focus on the user. In this role, you will create understanding and empathy around user needs, stated and unstated, for your entire product team including designers, product managers, and engineers. You will do so by conducting primary research, exploring the behaviors and motivations of our users through methods like field visits, ethnography, surveys, usability testing, and logs analysis. Your research will help us create useful, usable, and delightful new products and features for people as well as continually innovating on our existing products. You\u2019ll inspire change at all stages of product development by delivering compelling, written, in-person and visual presentations on your findings.<br><br>The UXR community at Google is unique. As part of our group, you will have the chance to work not only with the other UXRs on your immediate team but to work and learn from UXRs across the company through regular in-person meetups, established mentorship programs, access to our internal research tools, and 20% projects. Google is a place where UXRs can do their best work.</p><p>User experience (UX) is at the forefront of how we create intuitive, innovative, and beautiful products that people love. We strive to learn and understand our users\u2019 needs, behaviors, and emotions to yield insights that inform product strategy and guide the design of the experiences we create.
