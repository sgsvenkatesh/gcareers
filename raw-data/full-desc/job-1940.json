    "description": "<p>As a member of the Global Communications &amp; Public Affairs team, you will work cross-functionally to help communicate with journalists and other thought leaders; devise specific communications materials and campaigns based on understanding of journalists&#39; interests; engage in face-to-face meetings with commentators and other opinion formers; develop print and web-based material supporting these campaigns; and counter misinformation that might interfere with our business and ability to serve our users. We&#39;re looking for great communicators who can understand complex issues and explain them in person and also via well written, simple blog posts, FAQs, video scripts and more.</p>\n\n\n<p>As a Communications Manager, you will work closely with our Public Policy, Product Policy, Legal, and Operations teams to help manage policy communications for Ads. You will focus on Ads Policy and Risk and help manage issues that come up around our ads and commerce products. Additionally, you&#39;ll work as a close advisor to our Product, Marketing, and Sales teams, and will partner with media outlets and influencers across the country. In this role, you will be on the front lines of issues related to ads and will have the opportunity to shape communications and our response to these business-critical issues.</p><p>It&#39;s our job to help inform and educate users, advertisers, partners, opinion leaders--and our own employees--about the benefits of Google&#39;s products, our distinctive company culture/values, and our approach to the big public policy issues of the day. We are looking for quick-witted, entrepreneurial and intellectually curious people to join the team. To succeed here, you&#39;ll need to be able to combine creativity with the organizational skills to manage numerous different projects to tight deadlines simultaneously, as well as enjoy pitching to all kinds of journalists, bloggers and commentators (we find it hard too!), or producing internal communications and events for our employees. Things happen quickly at Google and to get stuff done here you need to be an enthusiastic team player - a self-starter who can work cross-functionally and isn&#39;t frightened to take risks or try out new ways of doing things.</p>",
