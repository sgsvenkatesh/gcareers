    "description": "<p>People Ops is always looking to make the experience of work better and more meaningful for Googlers. But innovating (and operating!) is increasingly complex when Googlers work in more than 50 countries, each with its own unique practices and regulations. The Diversity, Integrity &amp; Governance team works to make sure we not only do what\u2019s required by law, but that we continue to raise the bar and do what\u2019s right for Googlers all over the globe. From supporting LGBT rights to extending parental leave benefits, we aspire to do the right thing in every part of the world: to be fair and inclusive, disciplined but not rigid, and consistent but not bureaucratic.</p>\n\n\n<p>The Strategy, Communications, Outreach, Policy and Engagement (SCOPE) team works closely with the Employee Engagement (EE) Leadership team to help define and articulate Google\u2019s overarching Diversity, equity, and inclusiveness (DEI) strategy. The SCOPE team works holistically and cross-functionally across many areas, and as Diversity Strategy Manager, you&#39;ll partner with the EE team and other internal and external stakeholders.</p><p>Great just isn&#39;t good enough for our People Operations team (you probably know us better as &quot;Human Resources&quot;). Made up of equal parts HR professionals, former consultants and analysts, we&#39;re the advocates of Google&#39;s colorful culture. In People Ops, we &quot;find them, grow them, and keep them&quot;\u009d - we bring the world&#39;s most innovative people to Google and provide the programs that help them thrive. Whether recruiting the next great Googler, refining our core programs, developing talent or simply looking for ways to inject some more fun into the lives of our Googlers, we bring a data-driven approach that is reinventing the human resources field.</p>",
