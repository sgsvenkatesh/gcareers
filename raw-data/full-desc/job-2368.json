    "description": "<p>Google&#39;s projects, like our users, span the globe and require managers to keep the big picture in focus while being able to dive into the unique engineering challenges we face daily. As a Technical Program Manager at Google, you lead complex, multi-disciplinary engineering projects using your engineering expertise. You plan requirements with internal customers and usher projects through the entire project lifecycle. This includes managing project schedules, identifying risks and clearly communicating them to project stakeholders. You&#39;re equally at home explaining your team&#39;s analyses and recommendations to executives as you are discussing the technical trade-offs in product development with engineers.</p>\n\n<p>In this role, you\u2019ll keep an innovative engineering team firing on all cylinders. You will work closely with software engineers, product managers, and ODMs/OEMs to get high-quality products built, tested and released on time. You\u2019ll coordinate many fast-changing, moving parts and still get them to come together as a product. You\u2019ll need excellent communication skills in order to act as the central point-of-contact for all questions about schedules, quality and progress updates. You&#39;ll also be responsible for identifying and managing risks, making sound judgments about quality, and stopping (or speeding up) production at the right time.</p><p>Google&#39;s mission is to organize the world&#39;s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Only one thing consistently stands in the way between our users and the world&#39;s information - hardware. Our Hardware team researches, designs, and develops new technologies and hardware to make our user&#39;s interaction with computing faster, more powerful, and seamless. Whether finding new ways to capture and sense the world around us, advancing form factors, or improving interaction methods, our Hardware team is making people&#39;s lives better through technology.</p>",
