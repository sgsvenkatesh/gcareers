Your team designs and builds the hardware, software and networking technologies that power all of Google&#39;s services. As an Architecture and Design Engineer for Accelerator ASIC, you design and build the systems that are the heart of the world&#39;s largest and most powerful computing infrastructure. You develop from the lowest levels of circuit design to large system design and see those systems all the way through to high volume manufacturing. Your work has the potential to shape the machinery. cutting-edge data centers affecting millions of Google users.</p>\n\n<p>You will be part of a team developing cutting-edge ASICs used to accelerate computation in data centers. You will have dynamic, multi-faceted responsibilities in areas such as project definition, design, and implementation. You will participate in the design, architecture, documentation, and implementation of the next generation of data center accelerators.</p><p>Behind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technical Infrastructure team to keep it running. From developing and maintaining our data centers to building the next generation of Google platforms, we make Google&#39;s product portfolio possible. We&#39;re proud to be our engineers&#39; engineers and love voiding warranties by taking things apart so we can rebuild them. We&#39;re always on call to keep our networks up and running, ensuring our users have the best and fastest experience possible.</p>",
