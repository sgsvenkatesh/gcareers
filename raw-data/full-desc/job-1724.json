As a Technical Program Manager at Google, you lead complex, multi-disciplinary engineering projects using your engineering expertise. You plan requirements with internal customers and usher projects through the entire project lifecycle. This includes managing project schedules, identifying risks and clearly communicating them to project stakeholders.

You will be part of a team of professionals working with Apps Engineers and key partners in Search, Android, and Cloud (among others), focused on incident prevention strategies. Through applying technical and operational excellence to manage the investigation, you will ensure a swift and solid closure for resolution of reported incidents. You will shape the processes and tools for Apps-specific incident management, while maintaining a super-strong culture of trust, respect, and collaboration. You will be central to ensuring that Gmail, Drive, Docs, Calendar, and more will remain as the most innovative, useful, and, trusted guardians of user data in the world.</p><p>Google is and always will be an engineering company. We hire people with a broad set of technical skills who are ready to take on some of technology&#39;s greatest challenges and make an impact on millions, if not billions, of users.
