    "description": "<p>Google&#39;s products are known for their clean design, ensuring users can quickly and easily find what they&#39;re looking for. As an Engineering Designer, you leverage your strong technical background and understanding of &quot;good&quot;\u009d design to look for ways to streamline the user experience. You work closely with the product managers and development engineers throughout the entire production cycle. You design everything from high-level product flow to detailed UI mockups and then use your expert scripting skills to make your designs a reality.</p><p>In this role, you will own top-level RTL and integration of complex ASIC designs. This is a highly cross-functional and central role that will require interactions with numerous ASIC development teams. You will own deliverables to the Physical Design team at various project milestones. You will also be directly involved in defining and creating methodologies that enable a highly efficient design environment for all ASIC engineers.</p><p>Behind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technical Infrastructure team to keep it running. From developing and maintaining our data centers to building the next generation of Google platforms, we make Google&#39;s product portfolio possible. We&#39;re proud to be our engineers&#39; engineers and love voiding warranties by taking things apart so we can rebuild them. We&#39;re always on call to keep our networks up and running, ensuring our users have the best and fastest experience possible.</p>",
