    "description": "<p>Google&#39;s software engineers develop the next-generation technologies that change how billions of users connect, explore, and interact with information and one another. Our products need to handle information at massive scale, and extend well beyond web search. We&#39;re looking for engineers who bring fresh ideas from all areas, including information retrieval, distributed computing, large-scale system design, networking and data storage, security, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, UI design and mobile; the list goes on and is growing every day. As a software engineer, you will work on a specific project critical to Google\u2019s needs with opportunities to switch teams and projects as you and our fast-paced business grow and evolve. We need our engineers to be versatile, display leadership qualities and be enthusiastic to take on new problems across the full-stack as we continue to push technology forward.<br><br>With your technical expertise you manage individual projects priorities, deadlines and deliverables. You design, develop, test, deploy, maintain, and enhance software solutions.</p>\n\n<p>At Google, you will have the opportunity to find the perfect blend of software design practices and hardware development complexity. In this role, you will use your software engineering expertise to help solve complex problems including but not limited to hardware acceleration, performance bottlenecks, computer architecture, verifying digital design chips, automation, and machine learning. Whether your strength is in software coding, with a good understanding of hardware, or you are a hardware engineer with software proficiency, this balanced role will let you shine in both disciplines at the same time. </p><p>Platforms Engineering performs research, design and development for the hardware, software and networking technologies that power all of Google&#39;s products and services (including Google Cloud Platform, Tensor Processing Units, Android, Chrome, VR, Gmail, Maps and more). We constantly work on solutions to counter the slowing of Moore\u2019s Law. Platforms offers impactful projects at every level of the technology stack, from the chip level to massive distributed systems design and software development.</p><p>Behind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technical Infrastructure team to keep it running. From developing and maintaining our data centers to building the next generation of Google platforms, we make Google&#39;s product portfolio possible. We&#39;re proud to be our engineers&#39; engineers and love voiding warranties by taking things apart so we can rebuild them. We&#39;re always on call to keep our networks up and running, ensuring our users have the best and fastest experience possible.</p>",
