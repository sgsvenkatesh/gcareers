    "description": "<p>Our computational challenges are so big, complex and unique we can&#39;t just purchase off-the-shelf hardware, we&#39;ve got to make it ourselves. Your team designs and builds the hardware, software and networking technologies that power all of Google&#39;s services. As a Hardware Engineer, you design and build the systems that are the heart of the world&#39;s largest and most powerful computing infrastructure. You develop from the lowest levels of circuit design to large system design and see those systems all the way through to high volume manufacturing. Your work has the potential to shape the machinery that goes into our cutting-edge data centers affecting millions of Google users.</p>\n\n\n<p>In this role, you will work cross-functionally to deliver high quality hardware system. Our team is responsible for hardware system validation and quality optimization for the next generation of Google\u2019s consumer devices. We provide validation requirements for internal a d external stakeholders, identify system risks and critical design parameters, and develop and execute automation tools in a large scale. In this role, you will also perform factory test failure analysis by collaborating with cross-functional teams in system level validation in EE/SI, Coexistence, Peak Power Management, and Performance Regression.</p><p>Google&#39;s mission is to organize the world&#39;s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Our Hardware team researches, designs, and develops new technologies and hardware to make our user&#39;s interaction with computing faster, more powerful, and seamless. Whether finding new ways to capture and sense the world around us, advancing form factors, or improving interaction methods, our Hardware team is making people&#39;s lives better through technology.</p>",
