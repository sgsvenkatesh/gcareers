    "description": "<p>As a member of the Global Communications &amp; Public Affairs team, you will work cross-functionally to help communicate with journalists and other thought leaders; devise specific communications materials and campaigns based on understanding of journalists&#39; interests; engage in face-to-face meetings with commentators and other opinion formers; develop print and web-based material supporting these campaigns; and counter misinformation that might interfere with our business and ability to serve our users. We&#39;re looking for great communicators who can understand complex issues and explain them in person and also via well written, simple blog posts, FAQs, video scripts and more.<br><br>As a leader, you will keep your team on track with the overall strategy, giving them direction when it comes to specific product and business area decisions. You will also provide direct communications support for senior executives.</p>\n\n\n<p>As part of of the music communications team, you will help build the overall strategy for Music communications, including surfacing and telling artist stories, highlighting popular and emerging artists on YouTube -- all while aligning your initiatives with overall goals of the business. You will also provide direct communications support for senior executives on our Music team and help manage the external communications around our ongoing music negotiations.</p><p>It&#39;s our job to help inform and educate users, advertisers, partners, opinion leaders--and our own employees--about the benefits of Google&#39;s products, our distinctive company culture/values, and our approach to the big public policy issues of the day. We are looking for quick-witted, entrepreneurial and intellectually curious people to join the team. To succeed here, you&#39;ll need to be able to combine creativity with the organizational skills to manage numerous different projects to tight deadlines simultaneously, as well as enjoy pitching to all kinds of journalists, bloggers and commentators (we find it hard too!), or producing internal communications and events for our employees. Things happen quickly at Google and to get stuff done here you need to be an enthusiastic team player - a self-starter who can work cross-functionally and isn&#39;t frightened to take risks or try out new ways of doing things.</p>",
