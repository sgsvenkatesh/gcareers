    "description": "<p>Whether you&#39;re on a consumer product (like Gmail, Search, Maps, Chrome, Android) or a business product (Google Ads, AdSense, Google Marketing Platform, Analytics), you take part in a complete marketing experience as you lead every facet of the product&#39;s journey. From determining positioning, naming, competitive analysis, feature prioritization and external communications, you help shape the voice of the product and help it grow a consumer base. This means you work with a cross-functional team across Sales, corporate communications, legal, webmasters, product development, engineering and more. In this role, you&#39;ll be involved with product marketing strategy from beginning to end.</p>\n\n\n<p>As Marketing Communications Manager, you will assess opportunities across events and audiences, develop and execute strategies, create messaging, bring industry research to market and build campaigns to drive growth and engagement. You are a strategic, creative and analytical leader who is able to break down problems and drive to solutions while determining positioning, naming, external communications, and activation strategies for the vertical. \nYou\u2019ll work with external content and events agencies and internal cross-functional teams to plan and execute a comprehensive program of outreach and education, event participation, project management with internal and external stakeholders, process innovation, reporting and analysis, and other project-based work.</p><p>Know the user. Know the magic. Connect the two. At its core, marketing at Google starts with technology and ends with the user, bringing both together in unconventional ways. Our job is to demonstrate how Google&#39;s products solve the world&#39;s problems--from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can--changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.</p>",
