    "description": "<p>Our network operates reliably at a large scale around the world and 24/7. Google\u2019s Network Architecture team defines and provides all manner of architectural elements, building blocks and technologies that allow Google&#39;s production network infrastructure to meet the needs of our users. Given the size and complexity of our network, we face a constant stream of opportunities. The ever-evolving set of technologies we use to solve these challenges are used by innovative and dynamic problem-solvers with expertise in all aspects of network management.</p>\n\n<p>In this role, you&#39;ll be responsible for defining the IP network architecture, peering edge and backbone networks. This includes driving the technology evolution of every aspect of Google\u2019s IP networking stack with a focus on software-defined networking (SDN). \n</p>\n\n<p>You&#39;ll specify the standards and architectural guidelines for the layer-3 network, define scaling domains, establish and design service-level agreements (SLAs) for the network, provide SDN building blocks and translate Google service needs into new or evolving network functions. You have a developed understanding of all current and evolving technology options for layer-3 to 7 network design and the ability to apply your knowledge to creative, scalable and cost-effective solutions. \n</p>\n\n<p>You&#39;ll be responsible for effectively documenting and communicating these architectural guidelines through documented standards. You\u2019ll work closely with Network Engineering, Network Design and Network Technology Development teams to carefully consider and incorporate the future scalability and technology needs. You&#39;re a critical and strategic thinker, able to absorb and process large amounts of technical information in a continuously evolving environment.</p><p>Behind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technical Infrastructure team to keep it running. From developing and maintaining our data centers to building the next generation of Google platforms, we make Google&#39;s product portfolio possible. We&#39;re proud to be our engineers&#39; engineers and love voiding warranties by taking things apart so we can rebuild them. We&#39;re always on call to keep our networks up and running, ensuring our users have the best and fastest experience possible.</p>",
