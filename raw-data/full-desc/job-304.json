    "description": "<p>Google&#39;s known for our innovative technologies, products and services -- and for the people behind them. Whether you are making our staffing systems more efficient, planning for our growth, building relationships on college campuses or cultivating the next generation of computer scientists, you have an eye on the staffing needs of Google and the broader hiring landscape. You are focused on cultivating outstanding candidates for Google&#39;s long-term hiring needs, and work across a cross-functional and international group of staffing teams. You are both scrappy and resourceful, creative and driven -- and excited to share the magic of working at Google.</p>\n\n\n<p>As a Senior Process Improvement Analyst you will work in cross-functional teams to study and deeply understand what makes People Operations at Google work best. You will use advanced quantitative methods, as well as qualitative methods to identify what is most important to the performance of people operations, and staffing in particular. You will develop a rich understanding of customer requirements, measure our performance against those requirements, and identify and deliver improvements. You will also often work directly with Engineering Product Managers to guide software design in support of People Operations.</p><p>Great just isn&#39;t good enough for our People Operations team (you probably know us better as &quot;\u0098Human Resources&quot;). Made up of equal parts HR professionals, former consultants and analysts, we&#39;re the advocates of Google&#39;s colorful culture. In People Ops, we &quot;find them, grow them, and keep them&quot;\u009d - we bring the world&#39;s most innovative people to Google and provide the programs that help them thrive. Whether recruiting the next great Googler, refining our core programs, developing talent or simply looking for ways to inject some more fun into the lives of our Googlers, we bring a data-driven approach that is reinventing the human resources field.</p>",
