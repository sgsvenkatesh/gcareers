    "description": "<p>Our computational challenges are so big, complex and unique we can&#39;t just purchase off-the-shelf hardware, we&#39;ve got to make it ourselves. Your team designs and builds the hardware, software and networking technologies that power all of Google&#39;s services. As a Hardware Engineer, you design and build the systems that are the heart of the world&#39;s largest and most powerful computing infrastructure. You develop from the lowest levels of circuit design to large system design and see those systems all the way through to high volume manufacturing. Your work has the potential to shape the machinery that goes into our cutting-edge data centers affecting millions of Google users.</p>\n\n\n<p>In this role, you will help design, verify, and deploy ASIC projects through emulation based prototyping. Having a successful prototyping campaign helps to ensure success of these critical projects. However, as designs continue to increase in size and complexity, emulation becomes even more important in meeting verification and bring-up milestones. \n</p>\n\n\n<p>As a Hardware Emulation Engineer, you will work directly with other emulation prototyping team members as well as designers, DV engineers, and software teams to deliver emulation based prototyping capabilities for our ASIC projects. This may include compiling projects targeting our prototyping platforms, debugging issues in both infrastructure and design, and assisting in the hardware and lab bring-up and verification of our ASIC systems.</p><p>Behind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technical Infrastructure team to keep it running. From developing and maintaining our data centers to building the next generation of Google platforms, we make Google&#39;s product portfolio possible. We&#39;re proud to be our engineers&#39; engineers and love voiding warranties by taking things apart so we can rebuild them. We&#39;re always on call to keep our networks up and running, ensuring our users have the best and fastest experience possible.</p>",
