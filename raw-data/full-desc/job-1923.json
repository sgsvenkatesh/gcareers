    "description": "<p>Google&#39;s projects, like our users, span the globe and require managers to keep the big picture in focus while being able to dive into the unique engineering challenges we face daily. As a Technical Program Manager at Google, you lead complex, multi-disciplinary engineering projects using your engineering expertise. You plan requirements with internal customers and usher projects through the entire project lifecycle. This includes managing project schedules, identifying risks and clearly communicating them to project stakeholders. You&#39;re equally at home explaining your team&#39;s analyses and recommendations to executives as you are discussing the technical trade-offs in product development with engineers.<br><br>Using your technical and leadership expertise, you run Engineering-focused projects that are well-defined under supervision.</p>\n\n<p>The Technical Program Manager (TPM) role within Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is at the heart of fulfilling SRE\u2019s mission: making things faster, more reliable, and preparing for the continued growth of Google&#39;s infrastructure. As a TPM, you ensure that systems and services are carefully planned and deployed, taking into account multiple variables such as price, availability and scheduling, while always keeping the bigger picture in mind. You are comfortable driving massive projects which span many teams, have a strong interest in doing the right thing for our users and always think critically and strategically about Google as a business. You are equally at home explaining your analyses and project recommendations to wider audiences as you would be discussing the technical merits of next generation architectures with Google&#39;s engineers, or building tools to automate and scale their impact.</p><p>Behind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technical Infrastructure team to keep it running. From developing and maintaining our data centers to building the next generation of Google platforms, we make Google&#39;s product portfolio possible. We&#39;re proud to be our engineers&#39; engineers and love voiding warranties by taking things apart so we can rebuild them. We&#39;re always on call to keep our networks up and running, ensuring our users have the best and fastest experience possible.</p>",
