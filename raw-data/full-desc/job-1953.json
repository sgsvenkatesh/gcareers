    "description": "<p>Our computational challenges are so big, complex and unique we can&#39;t just purchase off-the-shelf hardware, we&#39;ve got to make it ourselves. Your team designs and builds the hardware, software and networking technologies that power all of Google&#39;s services. As an ASIC Manager, you design and build the systems that are the heart of the world&#39;s largest and most powerful computing infrastructure. You develop from the lowest levels of circuit design to large system design and see those systems all the way through to high volume manufacturing. Your work has the potential to shape the machinery that goes into our cutting-edge data centers affecting millions of Google users.</p>\n\n<p>Google Engineers develop next-generation technologies that change how users connect, explore, and interact with information and one another. As an ASIC Manager for an extraordinarily creative, motivated and talented team, you&#39;ll develop new products that are used by millions of people.\n</p>\n\n<p>You&#39;ll work closely with Google Product teams to ensure their goals are met. You will also work with Physical and Manufacturing teams to ensure that designs are viable.</p><p>Behind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technical Infrastructure team to keep it running. From developing and maintaining our data centers to building the next generation of Google platforms, we make Google&#39;s product portfolio possible. We&#39;re proud to be our engineers&#39; engineers and love voiding warranties by taking things apart so we can rebuild them. We&#39;re always on call to keep our networks up and running, ensuring our users have the best and fastest experience possible.</p>",
