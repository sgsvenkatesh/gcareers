    "description": "<p>Google accountants are a savvy bunch who handle the core accounting responsibilities at Google. As a member of this team, you know your accounting principles and the full accounting process end to end. You&#39;ll advise on financial reports required by governmental regulations, and you&#39;ll review, analyze, and interpret financial and budgetary reports -- and all this sounds like fun to you. Every day is a new challenge, and you&#39;re continually looking for ways to help our team get better at what we do, in the most efficient way possible. A team player at heart, you collaborate with our global team, advocate best practices and roll up your sleeves to pitch in when it&#39;s all hands on deck. You move fast while keeping your attention to detail, and you tap into your problem-solving skills to support Google&#39;s business objectives.</p>\n\n<p>The Google Fixed Assets (gFA) team manages the Global Accounting for Google\u2019s entire CapEx portfolio, manufacturing operations and related expenses. This infrastructure is at the foundation of Google - the global data centers, networks and integrating hardware and software that powers both our unique customer products and services and our internal operations. \n</p>\n\n<p>As a member of this team, you&#39;ll find innovative ways to manage our complex set of transactions in the Technical Infrastructure (TI) area. You will be focused on improving the control environment in TI and playing a key advisory role to our business partners including Logistics, Supply Chain Planners and FP&amp;A teams.</p><p>The name Google came from &quot;googol,&quot; a mathematical term for the number 1 followed by 100 zeros. And nobody at Google loves big numbers like the Finance team when providing in depth analysis on all manner of strategic decisions across Google products. From developing forward-thinking analysis to generating management reports to scaling our automated financial processes, the Finance organization is an important partner and advisor to the business.</p>",
