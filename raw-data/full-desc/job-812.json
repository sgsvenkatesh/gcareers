    "description": "<p>Organizational Change Managers drive critical priorities for Google by leading and assisting in projects of all sizes. Drawing from your strong financial background, you work with a diverse team to manage projects from concept to implementation and keep Google-wide stakeholders informed as you go. You get down into the details of complex analyses without losing sight of the overall objective. When working on multiple projects at once, you intuitively know which issues to highlight and can bring key decision makers together to come up with effective solutions. Once a project is completed, you&#39;re able to clearly communicate the results and draw the key learnings for senior management. You are efficient and organized, making the most of everyone&#39;s abilities and holding the team to a high standard.</p><p>In this role, you will help transform Finance\u2019s systems and processes, working closely with Business and Engineering teams across the organization to help Googlers and other relevant stakeholders understand, embrace and sustain change. You will lead stakeholder identification and impact management, establishing and executing communication strategies, assessing readiness and managing training. You will inspire and articulate value and change management outcomes to leaders. As a trusted advisor and coach, you will be the advocate for our end users throughout the lifecycle of every project.</p><p>The name Google came from &quot;googol,&quot; a mathematical term for the number 1 followed by 100 zeros. And nobody at Google loves big numbers like the Finance team when providing in depth analysis on all manner of strategic decisions across Google products. From developing forward-thinking analysis to generating management reports to scaling our automated financial processes, the Finance organization is an important partner and advisor to the business.</p>",
