    "description": "<p>Whether you&#39;re on a consumer product (like Gmail, Search, Maps, Chrome, Android) or a business product (Google Ads, AdSense, Google Marketing Platform, Analytics), you take part in a complete marketing experience as you lead every facet of the product&#39;s journey. From determining positioning, naming, competitive analysis, feature prioritization and external communications, you help shape the voice of the product and help it grow a consumer base. This means you work with a cross-functional team across Sales, corporate communications, legal, webmasters, product development, engineering and more. In this role, you&#39;ll be involved with product marketing strategy from beginning to end.</p>\n\n\n<p>In this role, you will be part of Global Marketing at Google, an increasingly important driver of business success for the company across all products. Strategy and Operations is a core SWAT team of business thinkers who support the Chief Marketing Officer in setting global strategy, building the operational capabilities to scale with a rapidly growing function, and optimizing business growth. Your role is part Chief Strategy Officer, part Chief Operating Officer, and part Chief of Staff. You will work with teams and collaborate cross-functionally with key leaders across Marketing, Product, Finance, and Sales to solve our toughest challenges, lead high priority projects, and drive greater operational excellence.</p><p>Know the user. Know the magic. Connect the two. At its core, marketing at Google starts with technology and ends with the user, bringing both together in unconventional ways. Our job is to demonstrate how Google&#39;s products solve the world&#39;s problems--from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can--changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.</p>",
