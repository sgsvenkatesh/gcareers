    "description": "<p>The Hardware and Retail Marketing organization is responsible for driving the growth of Google&#39;s hardware brands, including but not limited to Google Pixel, Google Home, Pixelbook, wearables and accessories. We partner with product teams to understand the user, shape the product roadmap, and bring products to market through coordinated global media campaigns. Google is committed to building radically effective experiences for customers at the intersection of hardware, software and artificial intelligence, and we\u2019re growing the team.</p>\n\n<p>As the Global Digital Demand Generation and Growth Marketing Lead, you will be a strategic leader on the marketing team and will be responsible for leading all of our global digital programs aimed at bringing users to the site, driving conversions, and meeting our objectives. \n</p>\n\n<p>You will manage and mentor a team of experts in SEO, paid media, social and others. You will develop global strategies for growing our user base and business and will develop, plan, execute and measure integrated marketing campaigns that generate highly converted traffic. You have a passion for building, implementing and measuring new systems, processes and campaigns as well as provide quantitative and qualitative feedback on performance.\n</p>\n\n<p>To be successful in this role, you need to be a strategic thinker, a nuanced problem solver, an exceptional marketer with rich experience in executing global campaigns and driving business growth in an e-commerce channel. \n</p>\n\n<p>This is a critical and high-visibility role with the opportunity to make a direct impact on the future of a rapidly growing product and channel at Google.</p><p>Know the user. Know the magic. Connect the two. At its core, marketing at Google starts with technology and ends with the user, bringing both together in unconventional ways. Our job is to demonstrate how Google&#39;s products solve the world&#39;s problems--from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can--changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.</p>",
