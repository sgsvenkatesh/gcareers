    "description": "<p>Google&#39;s known for our innovative technologies, products and services -- and for the people behind them. Whether you are making our staffing systems more efficient, planning for our growth, building relationships on college campuses or cultivating the next generation of computer scientists, you have an eye on the staffing needs of Google and the broader hiring landscape. You are focused on cultivating outstanding candidates for Google&#39;s long-term hiring needs, and work across a cross-functional and international group of staffing teams. You are both scrappy and resourceful, creative and driven -- and excited to share the magic of working at Google.</p>\n\n\n<p>The Strategy and Operations organization serves as the central planning group for People Operations. We partner across the leadership team in People Operations and with Finance, Business Operations and other Google teams to lead business planning and manage strategic projects for the organization. You&#39;re a problem solver with a focus on driving impact.\n</p>\n\n\n<p>You&#39;ll work on confidential projects to enable Google leaders to make strategic company decisions. As an Analytical Lead, you&#39;ll provide business insights to enable executive-level decision making, define and measure success metrics for our programs and facilitate operational reviews to report progress to Google leadership.</p><p>Great just isn&#39;t good enough for our People Operations team (you probably know us better as &quot;Human Resources&quot;). Made up of equal parts HR professionals, former consultants and analysts, we&#39;re the advocates of Google&#39;s colorful culture. In People Ops, we &quot;find them, grow them, and keep them&quot; - we bring the world&#39;s most innovative people to Google and provide the programs that help them thrive. Whether recruiting the next great Googler, refining our core programs, developing talent or simply looking for ways to inject some more fun into the lives of our Googlers, we bring a data-driven approach that is reinventing the human resources field.</p>",
