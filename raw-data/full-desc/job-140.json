    "description": "<p>People Ops is always looking to make the experience of work better and more meaningful for Googlers. But innovating (and operating!) is increasingly complex when Googlers work in more than 50 countries, each with its own unique practices and regulations. The Employee Engagement (EE) team works to make sure we not only do what\u2019s required by law, but that we continue to raise the bar and do what\u2019s right for Googlers all over the globe. From supporting LGBT rights to extending parental leave benefits, we aspire to do the right thing in every part of the world: to be fair and inclusive, disciplined yet not rigid, and consistent but not bureaucratic. As part of EE, the Retention, Progression and Equity team focuses on the fairness and equity of our talent systems. Our mission is to employ retention mechanisms, system interventions and accountability measures that increase equitable outcomes in our people processes as well as improve career progression and retention.</p><p>While it is the norm for companies to have HR teams focused on delivering talent processes, it is unique to have a team 100% dedicated to assessing the fairness and equity of those processes, and course correcting along the way. As the Retention, Progression and Equity team, we are pioneers in the industry with subject matter expertise, deep understanding of the unique experiences of diverse Googlers, and unwavering commitment to equity. We focus on accelerating diversity and inclusion and provide a unique lens for Google\u2019s talent processes and systems, and address retention and progression while creating greater equity and fairness at Google.</p><p>Great just isn&#39;t good enough for our People Operations team (you probably know us better as &quot;Human Resources&quot;). Made up of equal parts HR professionals, former consultants, and analysts, we&#39;re the advocates of Google&#39;s colorful culture. In People Ops, we &quot;find them, grow them, and keep them&quot;. We bring the world&#39;s most innovative people to Google and provide the programs that help them thrive. Whether recruiting the next Googler, refining our core programs, developing talent, or simply looking for ways to inject some more fun into the lives of our Googlers, we bring a data-driven approach that is reinventing the human resources field.</p>",
