    "description": "<p>Google&#39;s custom-designed machines make up one of the largest and most powerful computing infrastructures in the world. The Hardware Testing Engineering team ensures that this cutting-edge equipment is reliable. In the R&amp;D lab, you design test equipment for prototypes of our machinery and develop the protocols used to scale these tests for the entire global team. Working closely with design engineers, you give input on designs to improve our hardware until you&#39;re sure it meets Google&#39;s standards of quality and reliability.</p>\n\n\n<p>Google&#39;s mission is to organize the world&#39;s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Our Hardware team researches, designs, and develops new technologies and hardware to make our user&#39;s interaction with computing faster, more powerful, and seamless. Whether finding new ways to capture and sense the world around us, advancing form factors, or improving interaction methods.\n</p>\n\n\n<p>As a Lab Manager, you will manage a team of hardware test engineers responsible for prototype bring-up, validation, and qualification of server, networking, and optical platforms. You will also be responsible for liaison between Engineering Design teams and the Lab team to insure lab resources are accounted for and to ensure we are ready for new products entering the research and development (R&amp;D) labs and or sustaining efforts. Additionally, you will manage lab budget, hiring, performance management, and the well-being of the team.</p><p>Behind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technical Infrastructure team to keep it running. From developing and maintaining our data centers to building the next generation of Google platforms, we make Google&#39;s product portfolio possible. We&#39;re proud to be our engineers&#39; engineers and love voiding warranties by taking things apart so we can rebuild them. We&#39;re always on call to keep our networks up and running, ensuring our users have the best and fastest experience possible.</p>",
