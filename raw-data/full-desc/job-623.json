    "description": "<p>Google&#39;s projects, like our users, span the globe and require managers to keep the big picture in focus. As a Program Manager at Google, you lead complex, multi-disciplinary projects. You plan requirements with internal customers and usher projects through the entire project lifecycle. This includes managing project schedules, identifying risks and clearly communicating goals to project stakeholders. Your projects often span offices, time zones and hemispheres, and it&#39;s your job to keep all the players coordinated on the project&#39;s progress and deadlines.</p>\n\n<p>Google\u2019s Mobile Measurement team has been providing services to some of our largest advertisers for many years. They\u2019re at the forefront of mobile advertising and have become a thought leaders in the industry. We\u2019ve been working closely with some of the leading mobile vendors and academics to grow the industry and foster best practices. We recently launched the App Attribution Partnership (AAP) program to certify a small number of attribution vendors to ensure more accurate advertiser reporting and a better client experience. \n</p>\n\n<p>The AAP Program is a cross-functional effort that spans Business Development, Sales, Marketing, Product and Engineering. This role, the Partner Program Manager, will sit between these groups and create the scalable processes and tools to support the program. There are a few main areas where process needs to be built.\n</p>\n\n<p>Education is a fundamental component of this program and it\u2019s important that Google Ad&#39;s Sales teams understand the setup process and reporting defaults for each partner. This role will include creating reference materials for each of the partner\u2019s platform and coordinate trainings with global Sales teams.</p><p>Users come first at Google. Nowhere is this more important than on our Advertising &amp; Commerce team: we believe that ads and commercial information can be highly useful to our users if, and only if, that information is relevant to what our users wish to find or do. Advertisers worldwide use Google Ads to promote their products; publishers use AdSense to serve relevant ads on their website; and business around the world use our products (like Google Shopping, and Google Wallet) to support their online businesses and bring users into their offline stores. We build and maintain the platforms that have made Google what it is today, and are constantly innovating to deliver the most effective advertising and commerce opportunities of tomorrow.</p>",
