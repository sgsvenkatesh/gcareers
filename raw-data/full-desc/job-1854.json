    "description": "<p>Technical Writers communicate complex information clearly, concisely and accurately, and without relying on jargon. As a Technical Writer, your role involves tasks such as writing conceptual overviews and procedures, reading and writing example code, or updating help center queries and FAQs. Technical Writers play a big part at Google. They are a key link between Google Engineers, Product Managers, Marketing Associates, Developer Advocates, as well as Client Developers and users, tying together many vital but disparate parts of the Google ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p>As a Technical Writer working on developer products, you might support some of the world&#39;s most popular developer platforms, including APIs for the Android Platform, Google Maps API, App Engine and Chrome. You will communicate with external developers worldwide and/or internal Google audiences through conceptual documentation, detailed developer guides, code samples, API references, and other online materials. You might have a background as a developer, and write as a hobby; or perhaps you&#39;re an experienced communicator who loves digging deep into code. One thing is for certain - you are passionate about helping developers do amazing things.</p><p>Google is and always will be an engineering company. We hire people with a broad set of technical skills who are ready to take on some of technology&#39;s greatest challenges and make an impact on millions, if not billions, of users. At Google, engineers not only revolutionize search, they routinely work on massive scalability and storage solutions, large-scale applications and entirely new platforms for developers around the world. From Google Ads to Chrome, Android to YouTube, Social to Local, Google engineers are changing the world one technological achievement after another.</p>",
