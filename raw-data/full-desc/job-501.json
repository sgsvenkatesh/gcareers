    "description": "<p>At Google we spend hundreds of millions of dollars with vendors every year. The Supplier Sourcing team gets things done for Google, from tasks like buying hardware, software and professional services to managing facilities and various technology services globally. Through the strong and unique relationships we have with internal stakeholders and the right vendors, our team ensures that Google gets the best value for our purchases. As a member of a larger team, you drive a number of procurement-related activities such as guiding vendors through our shifting needs and supplying internal clients with sound purchasing advice. You craft and lead a multi-step sourcing process and innovative e-auctions to finalize high-dollar, high-risk proposals and contract negotiations. In some cases, you secure competitive rates for Google by translating our business needs into familiar &quot;commodity&quot; terms for the marketplace.</p><p>The name Google came from &quot;googol,&quot; a mathematical term for the number 1 followed by 100 zeros. And nobody at Google loves big numbers like the Finance team when providing in depth analysis on all manner of strategic decisions across Google products. From developing forward-thinking analysis to generating management reports to scaling our automated financial processes, the Finance organization is an important partner and advisor to the business.</p>",
