    "description": "<p>Our computational challenges are so big, complex and unique we can&#39;t just purchase off-the-shelf hardware, we&#39;ve got to make it ourselves. Your team designs and builds the hardware, software and networking technologies that power all of Google&#39;s services. You&#39;ll work to design and build the systems that are the heart of the world&#39;s largest and most powerful computing infrastructure. You develop from the lowest levels of circuit design to large system design and see those systems all the way through to high volume manufacturing. Your work has the potential to shape the machinery that goes into our cutting-edge data centers affecting millions of Google users.</p>\n\n<p>Google AI applies cutting-edge research to create products and businesses that positively transform how people live, work, and play.\n</p>\n\n<p>Our team works with researchers to take concepts from idea to execution as Google AI initiatives or independent companies. We aim to develop products that empower people, whether by elevating creativity, creating opportunity, advancing health, or more.\n</p>\n\n<p>As an entrepreneurial domain expert, you\u2019ll join our AI-enabled chip design team and guide it from research proof-of-concept to viable product for internal/external users. \n</p>\n\n<p>You have firsthand experience as a chip designer, with a deep understanding for design workflows/designers, and you bring an informed long-term point of view on future changes to chip design.</p><p>There is always more information out there, and the Research and Machine Intelligence team has a never-ending quest to find it and make it accessible. We&#39;re constantly refining our signature search engine to provide better results, and developing offerings like Google Instant, Google Voice Search and Google Image Search to make it faster and more engaging. We&#39;re providing users around the world with great search results every day, but at Google, great just isn&#39;t good enough. We&#39;re just getting started.</p>",
