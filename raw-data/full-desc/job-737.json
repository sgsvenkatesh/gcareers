    "description": "<p>Brand Studio is a passionate team of creative thinkers and marketers. We protect and promote Google\u2019s brand and reputation through programs, products and narrative experiences that express Google\u2019s values in action across the world. As part of our team, you\u2019ll define and create the visual and strategic elements that comprise Google\u2019s brand and product identities. You\u2019ll articulate standards that harmonize and bring a uniquely Google point of view to all of our products and communications. By embracing user insights, strategic thinking, beautiful design and provocative execution, you will create delightfully intuitive (and inventive!) experiences that will define the future of Google\u2019s brand.</p>\n\n<p>Technology companies have the responsibility to protect data privacy and uphold data security. The way users and influencers perceive our stance on respecting their data has a huge impact on our brand and our future, shaping how they trust and advocate for us. Hence, it has become even more important to help them understand that we never stop protecting their data with our industry-leading security and that we respect their privacy through providing data controls and the ability to update privacy settings that work for them. At the same time, we help families make the most out of Google safely, teaching children the fundamentals of digital safety and citizenship. Ultimately we need to help people understand about these important topics for them to enjoy our services without worrying about their data privacy. As data privacy has become one of the most pressing topics facing technology companies today, it continues to remain a top priority for Google.\n</p><p>As the Brand Marketing Manager for Privacy, you are passionate about addressing one of the top concerns for users around the world, the privacy of their personal information they share online. You are someone with a passion for working on tough challenges, an appetite for working in a fast-paced environment with high executive visibility, and a desire to work on something of utmost strategic importance to the company and ultimately the future of the Internet.</p><p>Know the user. Know the magic. Connect the two. At its core, marketing at Google starts with technology and ends with the user, bringing both together in unconventional ways. Our job is to demonstrate how Google&#39;s products solve the world&#39;s problems--from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can--changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.</p>",
