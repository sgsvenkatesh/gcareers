    "description": "<p>At Google, we build products that organize the world&#39;s information and make it universally accessible to our users. These products are the lifeblood of who we are. As part of the Product Management team, you work closely with our engineers to guide products from conception to launch. You connect the technical and with the business, working with teams across Engineering, Sales, Marketing and Finance. With your technical expertise, you identify a project\u2019s setback and generate solutions for resolving them quickly. As a Product Manager, you help shape the future of Google products.</p> <p>We are building the thoughtful home, a home that takes care of the people inside it and the world around it. Our vision is one of powerful, intuitive, cross-surface experiences that wrap the first party hardware and our third-party ecosystem around the backbone of the Google Assistant. This is not about the techified, rarified smart home we\u2019ve heard about for years - the thoughtful home is for everyone. </p> <p>Critical to this mission is the effectiveness of our Google Home and Nest apps. They are core pillars of the experiences we are creating. Our vision is that our mobile apps become the command center of the thoughtful home. They\u2019re where users effortlessly set up, activate, control, manage, and understand all the devices in their homes. </p> <p>You will build outstanding mobile experiences for the people that use our mobile apps daily. You&#39;ll work with product verticals, including Nest Cams, thermostats, and doorbells, and be involved in surfaces, like Home Hub. You will drive streamlined integrations with partners across smart home and media. You will also learn about the connected &quot;smart&quot; home, and see how it&#39;s coming into its own.</p><p>Google&#39;s mission is to organize the world&#39;s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Our Hardware team researches, designs, and develops new technologies and hardware to make our user&#39;s interaction with computing faster, more powerful, and seamless. Whether finding new ways to capture and sense the world around us, advancing form factors, or improving interaction methods, our Hardware team is making people&#39;s lives better through technology.</p>",
