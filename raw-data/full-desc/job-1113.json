The program provides developmental opportunities to students from groups historically underrepresented in tech through technical training and professional development. Students from all schools, and students who identify with a group that is historically underrepresented in the technology industry, including but not limited to women, Black, Latinx, Hispanic, Native American, students with disabilities, and Veterans are encouraged to apply.\n<br><br>\nOur unique internship offers the opportunity to work on a software project alongside other EP interns and full-time Googlers, and provides the chance to bridge the gap between academic understanding and practical professional experience.\n</p><p>Google is and always will be an engineering company. We hire people with a broad set of technical skills who are ready to take on some of technology&#39;s greatest challenges and make an impact on millions, if not billions, of users. At Google, engineers not only revolutionize search, they routinely work on massive scalability and storage solutions, large-scale applications and entirely new platforms for developers around the world. From Google Ads to Chrome, Android to YouTube, Social to Local, Google engineers are changing the world one technological achievement after another.</p>\n\n<p><i>The program is open to qualified first and second-year undergraduate university students who meet the below criteria. We especially encourage applications from students underrepresented in the engineering and tech industry including women, Black, Latinx, Hispanic, Native American, Veteran and students with disabilities.</i></p>",
