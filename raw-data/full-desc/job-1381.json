    "description": "<p>As a Wireless Architect, you will work with other Global Security and Resilience Services (GSRS) teams as well as internal and external cross-functional partners across Google to grow and maintain Google\u2019s ultra high frequency (UHF) radio network. You will determine coverage needs and design appropriate systems to meet the needs of our ever expanding campuses. To ensure adequate coverage, you will be responsible for engineering and implementing various antenna designs/systems. You may also design high speed wireless data networks, covering a few hundred feet to several miles. Finally, drawing on your years of experience and to promote sustainable operation of the network, you will partner with internal customers, other engineers, and vendors to define internal standards and implement procedures based on best practices.</p><p>From keeping Googlers safe and secure to managing disruptive events, the ability to anticipate, deter, detect, and act are the pillars of Google\u2019s Global Security and Resilience Services (GSRS) team. As a member of GSRS you will help develop a culture where safety, security and resiliency are integrated into every facet of Google, including the creative process. You will help us continually identify, evaluate and monitor enterprise risks that could affect business activities and provide business leaders the information they need to make critical decisions.
