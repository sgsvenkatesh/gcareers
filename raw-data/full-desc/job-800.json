They are a key link between engineers, marketing associates, developer advocates, as well as all the external users and developers, tying together many vital but disparate parts of the Google ecosystem.</p><p>You will be a part of a team of technical writers who develop documentation for the Hardware Operations teams in the Google data centers. You will interact with engineering and other operations groups to define deliverables, priorities and standards. You will be responsible for writing and editing product documentation.</p><p>Behind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technical Infrastructure team to keep it running. From developing and maintaining our data centers to building the next generation of Google platforms, we make Google&#39;s product portfolio possible. We&#39;re proud to be our engineers&#39; engineers and love voiding warranties by taking things apart so we can rebuild them.
