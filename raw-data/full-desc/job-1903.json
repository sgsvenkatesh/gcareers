    "description": "<p>Google&#39;s projects, like our users, span the globe and require managers to keep the big picture in focus while being able to dive into the unique engineering challenges we face daily. As a Technical Program Manager at Google, you lead complex, multi-disciplinary engineering projects using your engineering expertise. You plan requirements with internal customers and usher projects through the entire project lifecycle. This includes managing project schedules, identifying risks and clearly communicating them to project stakeholders. You&#39;re equally at home explaining your team&#39;s analyses and recommendations to executives as you are discussing the technical trade-offs in product development with engineers.</p>\n\n<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is bringing computing to a whole new range of devices. We aim to make it much faster and less painful to build such products, and offer easy access to Google services on a turnkey basis -- Assistant, Cast, TensorFlow, Google Cloud Platform.\n</p>\n\n<p>Any Android developer can quickly build a smart device using familiar Android APIs and development tools, while staying highly secure with updates direct from Google. Android Things will also be a way for OEMs to build IoT products with the Assistant. This is an exciting time to be on the team who will play a major role in shaping the world of IoT. \n</p>\n\n<p>You will be working closely with important stakeholders of the cross-functional team: Engineering, Product Management, Leadership, Business Development, Partner Engineering, Developer Relations and external partner teams. You will also have the opportunity to work on a wide variety of projects.</p><p>Behind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technical Infrastructure team to keep it running. From developing and maintaining our data centers to building the next generation of Google platforms, we make Google&#39;s product portfolio possible. We&#39;re proud to be our engineers&#39; engineers and love voiding warranties by taking things apart so we can rebuild them. We&#39;re always on call to keep our networks up and running, ensuring our users have the best and fastest experience possible.</p>",
