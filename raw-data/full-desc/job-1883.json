    "description": "Google continues to explore opportunities in the Gaming industry to build on the company\u2019s strengths and suite of relevant brands. As a Product Marketing Manager for Gaming, you&#39;ll craft and build core marketing strategies and compelling marketing narratives and help bring our product stories to life with gamers. You will work cross-functionally with key stakeholders and internal/external developers to drive the full marketing mix. In addition to pushing internal stakeholders beyond their creative and strategic comfort zones, you will inspire agencies to do their best creative and strategic work.<p>Know the user. Know the magic. Connect the two. At its core, marketing at Google starts with technology and ends with the user, bringing both together in unconventional ways. Our job is to demonstrate how Google&#39;s products solve the world&#39;s problems--from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can--changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.</p>",
