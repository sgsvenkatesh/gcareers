    "description": "<p>Google&#39;s known for our innovative technologies, products and services -- and for the people behind them. Whether you are making our staffing systems more efficient, planning for our growth, building relationships on college campuses or cultivating the next generation of computer scientists, you have an eye on the staffing needs of Google and the broader hiring landscape. You are focused on cultivating outstanding candidates for Google&#39;s long-term hiring needs, and work across a cross-functional and international group of staffing teams. You are both scrappy and resourceful, creative and driven -- and excited to share the magic of working at Google.</p>\n\n\n<p>As a Marketing Manager for the Careers Website, you will manage the content and merchandising strategy for the Google Careers website, shaping how we promote jobs, how we support potential candidates, and how we help site visitors find their way to the best Google job for them. You will also ensure that we bring the appropriate talent pipelines to roles. You will partner with Social and Paid Media leads, our Events Marketing team, our Employment Brand lead, and others across Google to map, source, curate, and distribute content that solves unique needs of potential candidates, helping them see that Google is a place where they can make a difference. You\u2019ll do this on a global scale as we support hiring around the world. In this role, you will blend storytelling and data to build human connections that move the business forward.</p><p>Great just isn&#39;t good enough for our People Operations team (you probably know us better as &quot;Human Resources&quot;). Made up of equal parts HR professionals, former consultants and analysts, we&#39;re the advocates of Google&#39;s colorful culture. In People Ops, we &quot;find them, grow them, and keep them&quot;- we bring the world&#39;s most innovative people to Google and provide the programs that help them thrive. Whether recruiting the next great Googler, refining our core programs, developing talent or simply looking for ways to inject some more fun into the lives of our Googlers, we bring a data-driven approach that is reinventing the human resources field.</p>",
