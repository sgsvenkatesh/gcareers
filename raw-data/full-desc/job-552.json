    "description": "<p>At Google, our philosophy is build it, break it and then rebuild it better. That thinking is at the core of how we approach testing at Google. Unlike roles with similar names at the other companies, Test Engineers at Google aren&#39;t manual testers -- you write scripts to automate testing and create tools so developers can test their own code. As a Test Engineer, you navigate Google&#39;s massive codebase, identify weak spots and constantly design better and creative ways to break software and identify potential problems. You&#39;ll have a huge impact on the quality of Google&#39;s growing suite of products and services.</p>\n\n<p>As an Audio Test Engineer, you will manage one of the key consumer satisfaction metrics - functional performance of the device. You&#39;ll be a key member of the cross-functional team, working on launching the product. You&#39;ll also manage factory test stations from Concept to Mass Production.</p><p>Google&#39;s mission is to organize the world&#39;s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Only one thing consistently stands in the way between our users and the world&#39;s information\u2014hardware. Our Consumer Hardware team researches, designs, and develops new technologies and hardware to make our user&#39;s interaction with computing faster, more powerful, and seamless. Whether finding new ways to capture and sense the world around us, advancing form factors, or improving interaction methods, our Consumer Hardware team is making people&#39;s lives better through technology.</p>",
