    "description": "<p>In our User Experience (UX) teams, UX Researchers partner with Designers, Product Managers, Engineers, and Googlers across the company to improve the user experience and drive product excellence. Quantitative UX Researchers do this by leveraging empirical research methods from computer science, quantitative social science, statistics, econometrics, data science, and other fields to understand user behavior and extract meaningful patterns from large data sets.\n</p>\n\n<p>In this role, you\u2019ll combine skills in experimental design, statistical analysis, programming, and human-computer interaction to improve user experience. As a key member of a product team, you\u2019ll work with stakeholders across functions and levels. You\u2019ll solve challenging problems and empower the team to move forward by developing metrics, measuring results, and integrating new methodologies into existing systems. You\u2019ll do more than just crunch numbers: through reports and team engagement, you provide a UX perspective on quantitative data to help stakeholders understand their users. You\u2019ll also identify and quantify problems, and embark on new research areas worth exploring through innovative methods.\n</p>\n<p>This differs from data science roles as it involves the application of data science to User Experience problems, and many Quant UX Researchers at Google come from a data science background. The primary difference between this role and a pure data science role is a strong interest in understanding user needs. Day to day, this is expressed in work with Qualitative UX Researchers, UX Designers, and Engineering teams to ensure that we\u2019re addressing users&#39; needs.</p><p>User experience (UX) is at the forefront of how we create intuitive, innovative, and beautiful products that people love. We strive to learn and understand our users\u2019 needs, behaviors, and emotions to yield insights that inform product strategy and guide the design of the experiences we create. Our multidisciplinary UX teams include designers, researchers, content strategists, and engineers who are passionate about quality, usability, and performance. We collaborate closely with product managers, software engineers, and many others to solve complex challenges and craft powerful experiences that highlight our products\u2019 unique capabilities and personalities. Our work touches billions while exemplifying a key principle that is core to Google\u2019s philosophy: \u201cFocus on the user and all else will follow.\u201d</p>",
