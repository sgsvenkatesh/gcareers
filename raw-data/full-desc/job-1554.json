    "description": "<p>Google&#39;s projects, like our users, span the globe and require managers to keep the big picture in focus. As a Program Manager at Google, you lead complex, multi-disciplinary projects. You plan requirements with internal customers and usher projects through the entire project lifecycle. This includes managing project schedules, identifying risks and clearly communicating goals to project stakeholders. Your projects often span offices, time zones and hemispheres, and it&#39;s your job to keep all the players coordinated on the project&#39;s progress and deadlines.</p>\n\n\n<p>Google Shopping aims to revolutionize shopping by building great end-to-end user experiences for shopping journeys. Shopping transactions are key pillars to deliver on this goal.</p><p>Users come first at Google. Nowhere is this more important than on our Advertising &amp; Commerce team: we believe that ads and commercial information can be highly useful to our users if, and only if, that information is relevant to what our users wish to find or do. Advertisers worldwide use Google Ads to promote their products; publishers use AdSense to serve relevant ads on their website; and business around the world use our products (like Google Shopping, and Google Wallet) to support their online businesses and bring users into their offline stores. We build and maintain the platforms that have made Google what it is today, and are constantly innovating to deliver the most effective advertising and commerce opportunities of tomorrow.</p>",
