    "description": "<p>Brand Studio is a passionate team of creative thinkers and marketers. We protect and promote Google\u2019s brand and reputation through programs, products and narrative experiences that express Google\u2019s values in action across the world. As part of our team, you\u2019ll define and create the visual and strategic elements that comprise Google\u2019s brand and product identities. You\u2019ll articulate standards that harmonize and bring a uniquely Google point of view to all of our products and communications. By embracing user insights, strategic thinking, beautiful design and provocative execution, you will create delightfully intuitive (and inventive!) experiences that will define the future of Google\u2019s brand.</p>\n\n<p>As a Lead Product Marketing Manager, you&#39;ll focus on online security, helping users stay safe online. This means helping them understand that we never stop protecting their data and that we respect their privacy by providing data controls so they can choose the privacy settings that work for them. \n</p>\n\n<p>Whether it\u2019s the automatic protections we build into all of our products or our efforts to collaborate with the industry to help make the internet safer. You\u2019ll bring to the team a combination of product marketing and brand storytelling skills to communicate Google\u2019s online security narrative to users and thought leaders alike.</p><p>Know the user. Know the magic. Connect the two. At its core, marketing at Google starts with technology and ends with the user, bringing both together in unconventional ways. Our job is to demonstrate how Google&#39;s products solve the world&#39;s problems--from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can--changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.</p>",
