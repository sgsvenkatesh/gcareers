    "description": "<p>Google&#39;s projects, like our users, span the globe and require managers to keep the big picture in focus while being able to dive into the unique engineering challenges we face daily. As a Technical Program Manager at Google, you lead complex, multi-disciplinary engineering projects using your engineering expertise. You plan requirements with internal customers and usher projects through the entire project lifecycle. This includes managing project schedules, identifying risks and clearly communicating them to project stakeholders. You&#39;re equally at home explaining your team&#39;s analyses and recommendations to executives as you are discussing the technical trade-offs in product development with engineers.</p>\n\n<p>Google Domains enables Small and Medium Business (SMB) to easily establish their online presence and grow their business through Google-ecosystem products. As part of this mission, Google Domains serves customers directly through its own storefront, as well as providing registrar platform support for other products and entry points.\n</p>\n\n<p>As a Technical Program Manager, you will work directly with the Engineering group, Product Managers, business and cross-functional stakeholders to shape the product direction and see key projects through. A key part of the role is effectively turning business questions into data analysis, and provide meaningful recommendations on strategy, shaping the product roadmap and delivering new product features to external customers.</p><p>Behind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technical Infrastructure team to keep it running. From developing and maintaining our data centers to building the next generation of Google platforms, we make Google&#39;s product portfolio possible. We&#39;re proud to be our engineers&#39; engineers and love voiding warranties by taking things apart so we can rebuild them. We&#39;re always on call to keep our networks up and running, ensuring our users have the best and fastest experience possible.</p>",
