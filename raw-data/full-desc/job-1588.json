    "description": "<p>Google&#39;s projects, like our users, span the globe and require managers to keep the big picture in focus. As a Program Manager at Google, you lead complex, multi-disciplinary projects. You plan requirements with internal customers and usher projects through the entire project lifecycle. This includes managing project schedules, identifying risks and clearly communicating goals to project stakeholders.

Projects are developed and executed at the intersection of ambitious science and an urgent user need, or application. You will be working on <a href=\"https://atap.google.com/soli/\">Project Soli</a>, <a href=\"https://atap.google.com/jacquard/\">Project Jacquard</a>\n\n\n\n\nand other projects that are within ATAP.\n\n\n</p><p>You are a Technical Program Manager who will define and drive test/Quality Assurance programs for Project Jacquard and Soli.
