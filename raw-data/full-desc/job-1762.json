    "description": "<p>Research and Machine Intelligence is a high impact team that\u2019s building the next generation of intelligence and language understanding for all Google products. To achieve this, we\u2019re working on projects that utilize the latest techniques in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning (including Deep Learning approaches like Google Brain) and Natural Language Understanding. We impact products across Google including Search, Maps and Google Now.<br><br>We strive to be the best and the brightest in the fields of Research and Machine Intelligence and we\u2019re looking for talented software engineers that have applied experience to join our team. <br><br>As a Research Software Engineer in Research and Machine Intelligence, you work on a small team, collaborating closely with other product teams and you\u2019re able to switch projects as our fast-paced business grows and evolves. We need our engineers to be versatile and passionate to take on new problems. Because you\u2019ll be working with cutting-edge technology, you\u2019ll also get a chance to work closely with researchers across Google.</p>\n\n\n<p>Our team within Google AI Perception develops concepts, designs, user interfaces, user experiences, input and output devices, and interaction techniques. We are a highly motivated team and work in a fast-paced environment. We work both with near-term products to support and inform product decision, as well as, with experiments, explorations, and longer term research and development (R&amp;D) efforts. \n</p>\n\n\n<p>As a Research Software Engineer, you will join our team to explore research topics that allow Google to innovate and create new classes of wearable devices and interface methods. You will progress the scientific research in these areas while contributing to hands-on prototype development and the design of new architectures. Additionally, you will rapidly innovate, make progress, and stay connected to the research community by formulating partnerships with universities and publishing papers.</p><p>There is always more information out there, and the Research and Machine Intelligence team has a never-ending quest to find it and make it accessible. We&#39;re constantly refining our signature search engine to provide better results, and developing offerings like Google Instant, Google Voice Search and Google Image Search to make it faster and more engaging. We&#39;re providing users around the world with great search results every day, but at Google, great just isn&#39;t good enough. We&#39;re just getting started.</p>",
