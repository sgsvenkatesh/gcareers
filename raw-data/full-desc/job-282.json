    "description": "<p>As a member of a fast-paced multi-disciplinary team, you use your creativity and diverse range of engineering experience to explore solutions to a variety of engineering problems. As a mechanical engineer, you participate in the design, analysis, and prototyping of new concepts. You work in a manufacturing and product oriented development environment and collaborate with vendors and outside sources in order to see parts through to manufacture.</p>\n\n\n<p>In this role, you will provide Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and support for multiple portable electronic consumer products. You have experience with communicating results to product design engineers via technical presentations, along with excellent communication skills and the ability to work with multiple cross-functional teams in a matrixed organization.\n</p>\n\n\n<p>You will focus on drop simulations and some static analysis, though knowledge of thermal simulations may be required in certain situations.</p><p>Google&#39;s mission is to organize the world&#39;s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Our Hardware team researches, designs, and develops new technologies and hardware to make our user&#39;s interaction with computing faster, more powerful, and seamless. Whether finding new ways to capture and sense the world around us, advancing form factors, or improving interaction methods, our Hardware team is making people&#39;s lives better through technology.</p>",
