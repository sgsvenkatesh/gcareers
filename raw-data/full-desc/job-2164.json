    "description": "<p>Brand Studio is a passionate team of creative thinkers and marketers. We protect and promote Google\u2019s brand and reputation through programs, products and narrative experiences that express Google\u2019s values in action across the world. As part of our team, you\u2019ll define and create the visual and strategic elements that comprise Google\u2019s brand and product identities. You\u2019ll articulate standards that harmonize and bring a uniquely Google point of view to all of our products and communications. By embracing user insights, strategic thinking, beautiful design and provocative execution, you will create delightfully intuitive (and inventive!) experiences that will define the future of Google\u2019s brand.</p>\n\n<p>Whether you&#39;re on a consumer product (e.g., Gmail, Search, Maps, Chrome, Android) or a business product (e.g.,Google Ads, AdSense, Google Marketing Platform, Analytics), the Director of Brand Strategy for Brand Studio will take part in a complete marketing experience as you lead every facet of the product&#39;s journey. From determining positioning, naming, competitive analysis, feature prioritization and external communications, you will help shape the voice of the product and help it grow a consumer base. This means you will work with a cross-functional team across Sales, Corporate Communications, Legal, Webmasters, Product Development, Engineering and more. In this role, you&#39;ll be involved with product marketing strategy from beginning to end.</p><p>Know the user. Know the magic. Connect the two. At its core, marketing at Google starts with technology and ends with the user, bringing both together in unconventional ways. Our job is to demonstrate how Google&#39;s products solve the world&#39;s problems--from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can--changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.</p>",
