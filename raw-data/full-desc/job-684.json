As a member of this team, you know your accounting principles and the full accounting process end to end. You&#39;ll advise on financial reports required by governmental regulations, and you&#39;ll review, analyze, and interpret financial and budgetary reports -- and all this sounds like fun to you. Every day is a new challenge, and you&#39;re continually looking for ways to help our team get better at what we do, in the most efficient way possible. A team player at heart, you collaborate with our global team, advocate best practices and roll up your sleeves to pitch in when it&#39;s all hands on deck. You move fast while keeping your attention to detail, and you tap into your problem-solving skills to support Google&#39;s business objectives.</p>\n\n<p>You are a well-rounded who can be a key contributor in an enthusiastic growth environment. You have a proven track record working with global, high tech companies, and the desire to excel in everything you do.

Analysts on the Global Revenue Systems team collaborate with multiple teams to ensure that we have robust, scalable accounting and reporting processes to support our business partners to deliver on internal and external data requests.\n</p>\n\n<p>The Data Analyst for Revenue Reporting will be focused on executing on internal and external reporting requests, as well as implementing opportunities to optimize our accounting operations through programmatic automations.

Additionally, you will also work closely with these teams to develop scalable automations for accounting and reporting processes.</p><p>The name Google came from &quot;googol,&quot; a mathematical term for the number 1 followed by 100 zeros. And nobody at Google loves big numbers like the Finance team when providing in depth analysis on all manner of strategic decisions across Google products. From developing forward-thinking analysis to generating management reports to scaling our automated financial processes, the Finance organization is an important partner and advisor to the business.</p>",
