    "description": "<p>Our computational challenges are so big, complex and unique we can&#39;t just purchase off-the-shelf hardware, we&#39;ve got to make it ourselves. Your team designs and builds the hardware, software and networking technologies that power all of Google&#39;s services. As a Hardware Engineer, you design and build the systems that are the heart of the world&#39;s largest and most powerful computing infrastructure. You develop from the lowest levels of circuit design to large system design and see those systems all the way through to high volume manufacturing. Your work has the potential to shape the machinery that goes into our cutting-edge data centers affecting millions of Google users.</p>\n\n\n<p>As a Hardware Technologist and Implementation Lead, you will provide technical leadership with a focus on physical implementation, working with CMOS wafer foundries. You will manage and drive complex technical projects from the concept/planning stage through execution and closure. Additionally, you will facilitate collaboration between wafer foundry engineering\nteams, design IP vendor engineering teams, and your team.\n</p>\n\n\n<p>In this role, you will work closely with the industry&#39;s top wafer foundries to shape and influence their CMOS transistor roadmap, ensuring excellent PPA to power our infrastructure and data centers. Additionally, you will perform technical simulations and evaluations of foundry CMOS process nodes, high speed interfaces IP vendors, custom/semi-custom circuitry designs, mixed-signal and analog circuit peripherals, and sensors. You will be responsible for managing vendor collateral requirements, execution and deliveries, tracking issues and driving resolutions, identifying and creating strategic opportunities for innovation, and delivering high systems impact.</p><p>Behind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technical Infrastructure team to keep it running. From developing and maintaining our data centers to building the next generation of Google platforms, we make Google&#39;s product portfolio possible. We&#39;re proud to be our engineers&#39; engineers and love voiding warranties by taking things apart so we can rebuild them. We&#39;re always on call to keep our networks up and running, ensuring our users have the best and fastest experience possible.</p>",
