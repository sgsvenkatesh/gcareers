    "description": "<p>Whether you&#39;re on a consumer product (like Gmail, Search, Maps, Chrome, Android) or a business product (Google Ads, AdSense, Google Marketing Platform, Analytics), you take part in a complete marketing experience as you lead every facet of the product&#39;s journey. From determining positioning, naming, competitive analysis, feature prioritization and external communications, you help shape the voice of the product and help it grow a loyal consumer base. This means you work with a cross-functional team across sales, corporate communications, legal, webmasters, product development, engineering and more. In this role, you&#39;ll be involved with product marketing strategy from beginning to end.</p><p>As a Product Growth Marketing Manager, you will help increase app engagement across Google\u2019s suite of products. The Growth Team provides insights, best practices, tools, and services to help product and marketing teams across Google increase user acquisition and engagement.\n</p>\n\n<p>As a Product Marketing Manager (PMM), you will work closely with teams across Google to define and execute on roadmaps that drive product changes leading to growth. You will collaborate with product teams to help build growth models, identify opportunities to optimize products for growth, and design experiments that can help make our products stickier and more engaging for the people who use them each day. Growth is an evolutionary process, so you will develop ongoing relationships with teams to help build roadmaps with an eye towards sustainable, long-term growth.\n</p>\n\n<p>This is a highly collaborative role, requiring close interaction with product and marketing teams across Google.</p><p>Know the user. Know the magic. Connect the two. At its core, marketing at Google starts with technology and ends with the user, bringing both together in unconventional ways. Our job is to demonstrate how Google&#39;s products solve the world&#39;s problems--from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can--changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.</p>",
