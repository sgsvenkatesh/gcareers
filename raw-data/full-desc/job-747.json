    "description": "<p>Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is an engineering discipline that combines software and systems engineering to build and run large-scale, massively distributed, fault-tolerant systems. SRE ensures that Google&#39;s services\u2014both our internally critical and our externally-visible systems\u2014have reliability and uptime appropriate to users&#39; needs and a fast rate of improvement while keeping an ever-watchful eye on capacity and performance.</p>\n\n\n<p>SRE is also a mindset and a set of engineering approaches to running better production systems\u2014we build our own creative engineering solutions to operations problems. Much of our software development focuses on optimizing existing systems, building infrastructure, and eliminating work through automation. As a Site Reliability Engineer, you will be responsible for the big picture of how our systems relate to each other, using a breadth of tools and approaches to solve a broad spectrum of problems. Practices such as limiting time spent on operational work, blameless postmortems, and proactive identification of potential outages factor into iterative improvement that is key to both product quality and interesting and dynamic day-to-day work.\n</p>\n\n\n<p>SRE&#39;s culture of diversity, intellectual curiosity, problem solving, and openness is key to its success. Our organization brings together people with a wide variety of backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. We encourage them to collaborate, think big, and take risks. We promote self-direction to work on meaningful projects, while striving to create an environment that provides the support and mentorship needed to learn and grow.\n</p>\n\n\n<p>Behind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technical Infrastructure team to keep it running. From developing and maintaining our data centers to building the next generation of Google platforms, we make Google&#39;s product portfolio possible. We&#39;re proud to be our engineers&#39; engineers and love voiding warranties by taking things apart so we can rebuild them. We&#39;re always on call to keep our networks up and running, ensuring our users have the best and fastest experience possible.\n</p>\n\n\n<p>As the Principal Engineer, you will be working within the Site Reliability Team, representing the interests of production at Google. You will have proven technical ability and influence across multiple product areas as you work at the highest levels of Google and regularly participate in various design and engineering reviews, demonstrating your domain area expertise.</p><p>Behind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technical Infrastructure team to keep it running.
