    "description": "<p>Whether you&#39;re on a consumer product (like Gmail, Search, Maps, Chrome, Android) or a business product (Google Ads, AdSense, Google Marketing Platform, Analytics), you take part in a complete marketing experience as you lead every facet of the product&#39;s journey. From determining positioning, naming, competitive analysis, feature prioritization and external communications, you help shape the voice of the product and help it grow a consumer base. This means you work with a cross-functional team across Sales, corporate communications, legal, webmasters, product development, engineering and more. In this role, you&#39;ll be involved with product marketing strategy from beginning to end.</p><p>We are the global retail ads marketing team, and we own all business driving and growth, thought leadership and product marketing programs for Google&#39;s ads products targeting the retailer and brand manufacturer segment. Our programs touch both small and large retailer advertisers, and we often work with other product areas across Google to market entire solutions relevant to retailers (across Google Cloud Platform, Google Marketing Platform, Google Pay, AR/VR and Shopping Ads).</p><p>As a growth marketer you will set strategy for acquiring, onboarding and retaining small business retail advertisers. You will create content, and full funnel engagement programs, working closely with other marketers to identify opportunities along the customer lifecycle to drive product adoptions or reduce advertiser churn. Your goal will be to increase retailers\u2019 spend and product adoptions, while positioning Google as the best partner for growth. You\u2019ll be responsible for reporting and quant analysis of your programs.</p><p>Know the user. Know the magic. Connect the two. At its core, marketing at Google starts with technology and ends with the user, bringing both together in unconventional ways. Our job is to demonstrate how Google&#39;s products solve the world&#39;s problems--from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can--changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.</p>",
