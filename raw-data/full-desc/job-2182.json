    "description": "<p>Google&#39;s projects, like our users, span the globe and require managers to keep the big picture in focus while being able to dive into the unique engineering challenges we face daily. As a Technical Program Manager at Google, you lead complex, multi-disciplinary engineering projects using your engineering expertise. You plan requirements with internal customers and usher projects through the entire project lifecycle. This includes managing project schedules, identifying risks and clearly communicating them to project stakeholders. You&#39;re equally at home explaining your team&#39;s analyses and recommendations to executives as you are discussing the technical trade-offs in product development with engineers.</p>\n\n<p>The Network Capacity Engineering team is at the core of Google&#39;s network organization. This team determines how much capacity, where and when is needed to ensure that no user or customer demand goes unmet. This team oversees demand planning, converts demand to capacity, allocates network resources, and ensures network health across Google&#39;s wide range of users and customers base (Cloud, Search, Gmail, YouTube, etc). The fun doesn\u2019t stop at Google\u2019s massive WAN: the team also capacity plans the Campus/Data Center Network and Edge infrastructure with partner teams, making this role truly end to end.</p><p>Behind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technical Infrastructure team to keep it running. From developing and maintaining our data centers to building the next generation of Google platforms, we make Google&#39;s product portfolio possible. We&#39;re proud to be our engineers&#39; engineers and love voiding warranties by taking things apart so we can rebuild them. We&#39;re always on call to keep our networks up and running, ensuring our users have the best and fastest experience possible.</p>",
