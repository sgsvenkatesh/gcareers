    "description": "<p>Whether you&#39;re on a consumer product (like Gmail, Search, Maps, Chrome, Android) or a business product (Google Ads, AdSense, Google Marketing Platform, Analytics), you take part in a complete marketing experience as you lead every facet of the product&#39;s journey. From determining positioning, naming, competitive analysis, feature prioritization and external communications, you help shape the voice of the product and help it grow a loyal consumer base. This means you work with a cross-functional team across sales, corporate communications, legal, webmasters, product development, engineering and more. In this role, you&#39;ll be involved with product marketing strategy from beginning to end.</p>\n\n<p>The Consumer Marketing team oversees many of Google&#39;s largest and most strategic products including Search, the Google Assistant, Maps, Photos, Google Fi, Messaging, AR/VR, and Google Identity. Our global team is deeply integrated in product development, positioning, narrative, and go-to-market strategy. Whether we are incubating a new product or scaling a mature product, our team operates with a growth mindset and our work is rooted in user insights. We believe in innovative product marketing as much as we believe in cross-team collaboration and transparency. \n</p>\n\n<p>Product Marketing Managers will shape product roadmap decisions, influence feature development, and develop core positioning and messaging for new features with the objective of creating a simpler way for people around the world to get things done in their lives.</p><p>Know the user. Know the magic. Connect the two. At its core, marketing at Google starts with technology and ends with the user, bringing both together in unconventional ways. Our job is to demonstrate how Google&#39;s products solve the world&#39;s problems--from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can--changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.</p>",
