    "description": "<p>Our thirst for technology is a part of everything we do. The Data Center Engineering team takes the physical design of our data centers into the future. Our lab mirrors a research and development department -- cutting-edge strategies are born, tested and tested again. Along with a team of great minds, you take on complex topics like how we use power or how to run state-of-the-art, environmentally-friendly facilities. You&#39;re a visionary who optimizes for efficiencies and never stops seeking improvements -- even small changes that can make a huge impact. You generate ideas, communicate recommendations to senior-level executives and drive implementation alongside facilities technicians.</p>\n\n\n<p>As a Data Center Controls Engineer, you will assist in design, specification, and definition of requirements as part of the Global Controls Engineering team. Project scopes will include solution definition per requirements, system design, and working with system integrator partners to implement and test these solutions across one or more locations. You will participate in the design and specification, establishment and maintenance of global standards and provide consulting, training, and global support to data center operations. \n</p>\n\n\n<p>In this role, you will have a working knowledge of various systems and equipment including protective relays, breaker trip units, network switches, data concentrators, HMI software packages, power quality meters, and Modbus and 61850 GOOSE/MMS protocols, switchgear, generators, UPS, digital and analog controls and feedback devices, PLC and HMI/SCADA. You will use your technical experience to ensure compliance with codes and standards, develop infrastructure improvements, and serve as an expert in protection, networking, and/or electrical. In addition to responding to and resolving complex system service outages and operational failures, you will also be responsible for leading the framing, planning, and design of large scale/complex projects.</p><p>Behind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technical Infrastructure team to keep it running. From developing and maintaining our data centers to building the next generation of Google platforms, we make Google&#39;s product portfolio possible. We&#39;re proud to be our engineers&#39; engineers and love voiding warranties by taking things apart so we can rebuild them. We&#39;re always on call to keep our networks up and running, ensuring our users have the best and fastest experience possible.</p>",
