    "description": "<p>Google&#39;s software engineers develop the next-generation technologies that change how billions of users connect, explore, and interact with information and one another. Our products need to handle information at massive scale, and extend well beyond web search. We&#39;re looking for engineers who bring fresh ideas from all areas, including information retrieval, distributed computing, large-scale system design, networking and data storage, security, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, UI design and mobile; the list goes on and is growing every day. As a software engineer, you will work on a specific project critical to Google\u2019s needs with opportunities to switch teams and projects as you and our fast-paced business grow and evolve. We need our engineers to be versatile, display leadership qualities and be enthusiastic to take on new problems across the full-stack as we continue to push technology forward.</p>\n\n<p>Google aspires to be an organization that reflects the globally diverse audience that our search engine and tools serve. We believe that in addition to hiring the best talent, a diversity of perspectives, ideas and cultures leads to the creation of better products and services. Google is invested in increasing the pipeline of Computer Scientists and Software Developers, particularly those who are historically underrepresented in the field. Many aspiring Computer Scientists could benefit from a program that bridges the gap between academia and industry. \n</p>\n\n<p>The Google Engineering Residency Program is a 12-month fixed term role designed to jumpstart your career as a software engineer at Google. The Engineering Residency Program is a training and development program open to all qualified graduates who received a degree in Computer Science or Computer Engineering within the last 6 months, or who will receive a degree by the summer of 2019.\n</p>\n\n<p>The Engineering Residency program combines Computer Science education with hands-on software engineering experience in a supported, closely mentored cohort. Following an industry-focused training period, Residents move onto rotations embedded in engineering teams, working on complex programming projects with Google engineers. The goal of the Residency Program is to help Residents become productive and successful software engineers within the one year program. \n</p>\n\n<p><b>Make the transition:</b> The professional engineering environment is constantly evolving. Google&#39;s Engineering Residency Program is designed to accelerate the transition from school to industry, enabling Residents to have an impact right away.\n</p>\n\n<p><b>Learn new skills:</b> Our infrastructure is complex. As an Engineering Resident, you&#39;ll learn the things that are harder to teach in school - from large-scale distributed processing and Google-style test-driven development, to applied theory and code reviews, to developer workflow and beyond.\n</p>\n\n<p><b>Grow with peers:</b> With such a diverse set of backgrounds and perspectives, your peers will provide you with opportunities for learning and development throughout the program - and they&#39;ll serve as a lifelong network.\n</p>\n\n<p><b>Kickstart your career:</b> As an Engineering Resident, you&#39;ll have the ability to build technical skills, adjust to industry work, leverage a built-in support network, and access mentorship opportunities - all of which will kickstart your career in tech.\n</p>\n\n<p><b>Change the world:</b> Google&#39;s software engineers develop the next-generation technologies that change how users connect, explore, and interact with information and one another. We&#39;re looking for engineers who bring fresh ideas and who are ready to take on some of technology&#39;s greatest challenges and make an impact users. Google engineers are changing the world one technological achievement after another.\n</p>\n\n<p>Before the end of their residency year, Residents will be considered for full-time positions on Google Engineering teams, based on performance.</p><p>Google is and always will be an engineering company. We hire people with a broad set of technical skills who are ready to take on some of technology&#39;s greatest challenges and make an impact on millions, if not billions, of users. At Google, engineers not only revolutionize search, they routinely work on massive scalability and storage solutions, large-scale applications and entirely new platforms for developers around the world. From Google Ads to Chrome, Android to YouTube, Social to Local, Google engineers are changing the world one technological achievement after another.</p>",
