    "description": "<p>Google&#39;s projects, like our users, span the globe and require managers to keep the big picture in focus. As a Program Manager at Google, you lead complex, multi-disciplinary projects. You plan requirements with internal customers and usher projects through the entire project lifecycle. This includes managing project schedules, identifying risks and clearly communicating goals to project stakeholders. Your projects often span offices, time zones and hemispheres, and it&#39;s your job to keep all the players coordinated on the project&#39;s progress and deadlines.</p>\n\n\n<p>The Hardware Product Area (HWPA) team\u2019s objective is to identify and minimize risk to ensure the business is running smoothly. Risk management is important to protect Google, our customers and our employees. This is achieved by partnering with teams not only within HWPA but also with teams across Google, including Security and Privacy, Global Security, Resiliency Services and Contract Manufacturing. By partnering across Google, HWPA can integrate into the Enterprise risk management framework to scale our business.\n</p>\n\n\n<p>As a Risk Program Manager, you will partner with our business and cross-functional leaders to develop relationship and engagement strategy. You will also lead the agreement/decision-making process and develop and maintain ongoing relationships with our executive leadership and cross-functional teams.</p><p>Google&#39;s mission is to organize the world&#39;s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Our Hardware team researches, designs, and develops new technologies and hardware to make our user&#39;s interaction with computing faster, more powerful, and seamless. Whether finding new ways to capture and sense the world around us, advancing form factors, or improving interaction methods, our Hardware team is making people&#39;s lives better through technology.</p>",
