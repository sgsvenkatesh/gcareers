    "description": "<p>Our thirst for technology is a part of everything we do. The Data Center Engineering team takes the physical design of our data centers into the future. Our lab mirrors a research and development department -- cutting-edge strategies are born, tested and tested again. Along with a team of great minds, you take on complex topics like how we use power or how to run state-of-the-art, environmentally-friendly facilities. You&#39;re a visionary who optimizes for efficiencies and never stops seeking improvements -- even small changes that can make a huge impact. You generate ideas, communicate recommendations to senior-level executives and drive implementation alongside facilities technicians.<br><br>Through your leadership, you use your technical expertise to lead cross-functional teams to develop infrastructure improvements. You manage a team of engineers and assign Googlers to projects based on their capabilities and the project&#39;s demands.</p>\n\n<p>In this role as a Data Center Systems Architect, you will have the opportunity to demonstrate data center design and analyses as well as cross-functionally lead electrical, mechanical, automation and software engineers to solve challenging Google problems. You will also partner with business groups and internal customers to develop new technology to optimize our architecture throughout the data center, hardware, and software stacks improving the overall efficiency of our computing infrastructure.</p><p>Behind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technical Infrastructure team to keep it running. From developing and maintaining our data centers to building the next generation of Google platforms, we make Google&#39;s product portfolio possible. We&#39;re proud to be our engineers&#39; engineers and love voiding warranties by taking things apart so we can rebuild them. We&#39;re always on call to keep our networks up and running, ensuring our users have the best and fastest experience possible.</p>",
