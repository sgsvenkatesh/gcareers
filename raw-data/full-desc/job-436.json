They care deeply about cultivating relationships, have lively, thoughtful conversations with their candidates, and know our organization and its products well enough to articulate life-changing opportunities. As an expert in the talent needs of our business, you\u2019ll be an adviser to the extraordinary people you find, engage, and guide through Google\u2019s hiring process. By the time you\u2019ve introduced a would-be Googler to our partners in recruiting, they are comfortable, well informed, and excited about the possibilities that await them here. The demands of our company, as it continues to grow and transform the industry, are great. Your analytical mind, curiosity, and sincere approach to your work make you exceptional enough to meet them.</p><p>Great just isn&#39;t good enough for our People Operations team (you probably know us better as &quot;Human Resources&quot;). Made up of equal parts HR professionals, former consultants and analysts, we&#39;re the advocates of Google&#39;s colorful culture. In People Ops, we &quot;find them, grow them, and keep them&quot;- we bring the world&#39;s most innovative people to Google and provide the programs that help them thrive.
