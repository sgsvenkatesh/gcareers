    "description": "<p>We believe there are many problems in the world in which robotics could play a significant role in making it easier, faster and safer for people to get things done. We\u2019re looking for roboticists, designers, hardware and software engineers to help us explore these possibilities, develop breakthrough technologies, and build new products that could help millions of people.</p>\n\n\n<p>Robotics at Google is a research group devoted to exploring how machine learning can revolutionize the world of robotics. Recent advances in perception and deep learning have made it possible to envision autonomous robots that acquire a deep understanding of their environment through sensing and learning. This requires new, scalable approaches to learning in the physical world, as well as safe and data efficient approaches to continuously improving sensorimotor skills, which will ultimately enable autonomous agents to safely act in human-centered environments.</p><p>There is always more information out there, and the Research and Machine Intelligence team has a never-ending quest to find it and make it accessible. We&#39;re constantly refining our signature search engine to provide better results, and developing offerings like Google Instant, Google Voice Search and Google Image Search to make it faster and more engaging. We&#39;re providing users around the world with great search results every day, but at Google, great just isn&#39;t good enough. We&#39;re just getting started.</p>",
