    "description": "<p>Analytical Linguists work across Google to drive improvements in quality, classification, information structure, and natural language understanding and generation. As an Analytical Linguist you will work both on complex projects spanning multiple products, groups, and disciplines, and on tightly focused efforts to produce specific product components or answer specific research questions. Analytical Linguists work in many different areas and arrive with a wide variety of skills\u2014your specialization might involve natural language processing and understanding, phonology, phonetics, syntax, semantics, ontology, program management, human subject research, experimental design, statistics, corpus linguistics, large scale data acquisition, or any combination. This team is part of some of the most groundbreaking and exciting work at Google. It&#39;s our goal to use insights from linguistics and related fields to constantly improve our products.</p>\n\n\n<p>As a Linguist on the Text Classification team, you will collaborate with software engineers, product managers, and language experts to build high-quality text classifiers for the display advertising ecosystem. You will develop taxonomies and category sets, working closely with key stakeholders to understand product requirements. You will also set data labeling policies and designs and build and curate labeled cross-language datasets for classifier training and evaluation. Additionally, you will build and evaluate custom classifiers using machine learning tools and techniques to help Google better understand the web, mobile applications, and their users.</p><p>Users come first at Google. Nowhere is this more important than on our Advertising &amp; Commerce team: we believe that ads and commercial information can be highly useful to our users if, and only if, that information is relevant to what our users wish to find or do. Advertisers worldwide use Google Ads to promote their products; publishers use AdSense to serve relevant ads on their website; and business around the world use our products (like Google Shopping, and Google Wallet) to support their online businesses and bring users into their offline stores. We build and maintain the platforms that have made Google what it is today, and are constantly innovating to deliver the most effective advertising and commerce opportunities of tomorrow.</p>",
