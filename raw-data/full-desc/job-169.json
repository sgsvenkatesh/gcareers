We&#39;re a team of inquisitive and enthusiastic real estate, design, user experience, construction and facilities operations professionals who are constantly searching for new ways to improve workplace efficiency and make Google a great place to come to work everyday.\n</p>\n\n<p>The Development, Real Estate and Security (DRS) Consulting team designs strategic opportunities, through the lens of the user and the business, so we can deliver the best solutions to Google. We are guided by the discipline of user-centered design and traditional management consulting methodologies. </p><p>We are a team with diverse backgrounds, united by a culture of curiosity.
