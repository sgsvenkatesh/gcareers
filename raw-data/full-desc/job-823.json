    "description": "<p>Whether you&#39;re on a consumer product (like Gmail, Search, Maps, Chrome, Android) or a business product (Google Ads, AdSense, Google Marketing Platform, Analytics), you take part in a complete marketing experience as you lead every facet of the product&#39;s journey. From determining positioning, naming, competitive analysis, feature prioritization and external communications, you help shape the voice of the product and help it grow a loyal consumer base. This means you work with a cross-functional team across sales, corporate communications, legal, webmasters, product development, engineering and more. In this role, you&#39;ll be involved with product marketing strategy from beginning to end.</p><p>Google&#39;s digital tools help businesses tap into the potential of the web, reaching customers at the very moment they\u2019re looking to discover a product, learn about a new service or purchase something. Every month, these search and advertising tools help drive 100 billion visits to business websites globally, and create more than three billion direct connections like phone calls, online reservations and store visits between businesses and their customers. There are nearly 30 million small businesses in the U.S., employing almost half of the private sector workforce. These small business owners have a special dedication and passion for what they do, as well as a deep understanding for the economics of their business. As a member of Google\u2019s Small- and Medium-sized Businesses (SMB) Marketing team, you are part of an organization, whose programs and initiatives help these businesses all over the world get online, reach customers and grow using Google\u2019s technology.</p><p>Know the user. Know the magic. Connect the two. At its core, marketing at Google starts with technology and ends with the user, bringing both together in unconventional ways. Our job is to demonstrate how Google&#39;s products solve the world&#39;s problems--from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can--changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.</p>",
