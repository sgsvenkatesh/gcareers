    "description": "<p>Google&#39;s projects, like our users, span the globe and require managers to keep the big picture in focus while being able to dive into the unique engineering challenges we face daily. As a Technical Program Manager at Google, you lead complex, multi-disciplinary engineering projects using your engineering expertise. You plan requirements with internal customers and usher projects through the entire project lifecycle. This includes managing project schedules, identifying risks and clearly communicating them to project stakeholders. You&#39;re equally at home explaining your team&#39;s analyses and recommendations to executives as you are discussing the technical trade-offs in product development with engineers.<br><br>Using your extensive technical and leadership expertise, you manage projects of various size and scope, identifying future opportunities, improving processes and driving the technical directions of your programs.</p>\n<p>You will participate in all new project design reviews for data centers focusing specifically on the design performance at different stages of a design, as well as the portfolio of RFI\u2019s and RFC\u2019s. You will provide analytical feedback to the internal and external stakeholders on how to improve design performance in each design domain both on a project and portfolio level. Through effective monitoring of the performance of the internal design team and external vendors (Architectural Engineering firms), you will also drive closed loop lessons learned to continually improve. ject performance to minimize total costs of ownership as well as costs of poor quality deviations.</p><p>Behind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technical Infrastructure team to keep it running. From developing and maintaining our data centers to building the next generation of Google platforms, we make Google&#39;s product portfolio possible. We&#39;re proud to be our engineers&#39; engineers and love voiding warranties by taking things apart so we can rebuild them. We&#39;re always on call to keep our networks up and running, ensuring our users have the best and fastest experience possible.</p>",
