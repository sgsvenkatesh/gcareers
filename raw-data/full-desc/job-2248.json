    "description": "<p>Google&#39;s projects, like our users, span the globe and require managers to keep the big picture in focus while being able to dive into the unique engineering challenges we face daily. As a Technical Program Manager at Google, you lead complex, multi-disciplinary engineering projects using your engineering expertise. You plan requirements with internal customers and usher projects through the entire project lifecycle. This includes managing project schedules, identifying risks and clearly communicating them to project stakeholders. You&#39;re equally at home explaining your team&#39;s analyses and recommendations to executives as you are discussing the technical trade-offs in product development with engineers.</p>\n\n<p>The Data Infrastructure and Analysis (DIA) team within Google is responsible for developing an end-to-end integrated stack that serves the internal data management and analysis needs for Google\u2019s products and applications. We partner very closely with key Google products (Google Ads, AdSense, Payments, Shopping) whose infrastructure is underpinned by products from this stack, which offers a full spectrum of generic, highly extensible products for data ingestion, processing, storage and analysis.</p><p>Behind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technical Infrastructure team to keep it running. From developing and maintaining our data centers to building the next generation of Google platforms, we make Google&#39;s product portfolio possible. We&#39;re proud to be our engineers&#39; engineers and love voiding warranties by taking things apart so we can rebuild them. We&#39;re always on call to keep our networks up and running, ensuring our users have the best and fastest experience possible.</p>",
