    "description": "<p>Understanding natural language is at the core of Google&#39;s technologies. Teams within Natural Language Understanding (NLU) in Google Research guide, build and innovate methodologies around discourse and pragmatics, semantic analysis and representation, syntactic parsing and realization, morphology and lexicon development, speech recognition and synthesis. Current research focuses on information structure, dialogue systems, evaluation, data manipulation and analysis.\n<br>\n</p><p>A Computational Linguist has both knowledge of the linguistic phenomena and of the technology to model them. As a Computational Linguist Intern, you will collaborate with researchers and engineers in NLU/Machine Intelligence to produce linguistic models, analyses, high quality data and develop applications that improve our ability to understand and generate natural language.</p><p>Google is and always will be an engineering company. We hire people with a broad set of technical skills who are ready to take on some of technology&#39;s greatest challenges and make an impact on millions, if not billions, of users. At Google, engineers not only revolutionize search, they routinely work on massive scalability and storage solutions, large-scale applications and entirely new platforms for developers around the world. From Google Ads to Chrome, Android to YouTube, Social to Local, Google engineers are changing the world one technological achievement after another.</p>",
