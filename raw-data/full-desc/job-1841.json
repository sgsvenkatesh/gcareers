    "description": "<p>The Developer Relations organization helps keep us connected to the communities that love technology as much as we do. Our focus is on supporting third party developers who build applications and businesses on Google&#39;s platforms. Developer Advocates act as passionate advocates for Google technologies, and are vocal champions for developer interests within Google. This is a position for engineers who love connecting with developers and speaking publicly about cutting-edge technologies on conference panels, at user groups, on blogs and with the press. You also communicate internally with Product Managers. Chrome, Android, App Engine, HTML5, as well as our core G Suite and Ads APIs, are just some of the platforms you promote and support. Your work fosters a community of developers working with Google technologies and helps to drive strategy around Developer Relations.</p>\n\n<p>As a Developer Advocate, you will help accelerate Android&#39;s developer ecosystem, improve app and SDK quality, partner upstream with Android product and engineering to deliver great products to developers. You\u2019ll play a key role in shaping how we bring new Android capabilities to developers, while partnering with teams across Android to advocate the needs of developers, driving our strategy, narratives, best practices, events and outreach for Android developers globally. \n</p>\n\n<p>A key priority for the team is the annual release and developer preview. You\u2019ll dive deep with Product and Engineering on features, impact assessments and launch needs. You\u2019ll also work with third-party and first-party app teams as well as original equipment manufactorer (OEM) facing teams to collect feedback, build support channels and drive early compatibility and adoption.\n</p>\n\n<p>In this role, you will help expand our support for third-party SDK and library developers on Android. You\u2019ll work with teams across Android and Play to ensure SDK quality, improve workflows and build tools to understand SDK performance. You\u2019ll help drive the technical strategy and scale the program to developers worldwide. Additionally, you will shape the developer strategy for strategic initiatives such as privacy, security, connectivity, design, tools and others. Since developer needs vary by region, you\u2019ll advocate those during product design and organize tailored regional outreach.</p><p>Google is and always will be an engineering company. We hire people with a broad set of technical skills who are ready to take on some of technology&#39;s greatest challenges and make an impact on millions, if not billions, of users. At Google, engineers not only revolutionize search, they routinely work on massive scalability and storage solutions, large-scale applications and entirely new platforms for developers around the world. From Google Ads to Chrome, Android to YouTube, Social to Local, Google engineers are changing the world one technological achievement after another.</p>",
