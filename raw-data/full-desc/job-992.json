    "description": "<p>Our PeopleDev team works hard to ensure every Googler has access to the resources they need to become their best personal and professional selves. We leverage tools, technology, and innovative formats to scale learning and support Googlers at all stages of their careers \u2014 from Noogler Orientation, to manager training, to leadership development, and more. We have four key beliefs about learning \u2014 that it is personal, social, a process, and happens in real life \u2014 and we infuse these beliefs throughout the wide array of learning and development opportunities at Google. As a PeopleDev team member, you&#39;ll always be thinking about new ways to help others grow, and you share a passion for empowering Googlers to unlock their full potential.</p>\n\n\n<p>All Googlers deserve a great manager. As a Manager for People Development Programs, you\u2019ll lead a small team of talented program managers who deliver onboarding programs at key points in a manager\u2019s career - from becoming a manager for the first time, to managing other managers. Your work will impact thousands of managers and the Googlers reporting to them each year. You will improve manager capability at the enterprise level by ensuring each program achieves its learning objectives, while driving operational efficiency across a portfolio of scaled programs (i.e., New Manager Flagship, Noogler Manager Conference, Managing at Scale).</p><p>Great just isn&#39;t good enough for our People Operations team (you probably know us better as &quot;Human Resources&quot;). Made up of equal parts HR professionals, former consultants and analysts, we&#39;re the advocates of Google&#39;s colorful culture. In People Ops, we &quot;find them, grow them, and keep them&quot; - we bring the world&#39;s most innovative people to Google and provide the programs that help them thrive. Whether recruiting the next great Googler, refining our core programs, developing talent or simply looking for ways to inject some more fun into the lives of our Googlers, we bring a data-driven approach that is reinventing the human resources field.</p>",
