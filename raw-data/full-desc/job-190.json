    "description": "<p>Whether you&#39;re on a consumer product (like Gmail, Search, Maps, Chrome, Android) or a business product (Google Ads, AdSense, Google Marketing Platform, Analytics), you take part in a complete marketing experience as you lead every facet of the product&#39;s journey. From determining positioning, naming, competitive analysis, feature prioritization and external communications, you help shape the voice of the product and help it grow a consumer base. This means you work with a cross-functional team across Sales, corporate communications, legal, webmasters, product development, engineering and more. In this role, you&#39;ll be involved with product marketing strategy from beginning to end.</p>\n\n\n<p>Search continues to drive the core of Google\u2019s business and our mission to organize the world&#39;s information and make it universally accessible and useful. From sports scores to entertainment news to critical information about life choices, Search serves a wide range of information needs and carries the potential to make the lives of users everywhere better.\n</p>\n\n\n<p>As a Product Marketing Manager for Core Search, you will work closely with product teams to bring engaging and helpful Search features to life on a global scale. You will drive alignment with project managers, engineers, international marketing counterparts, designers, and communications partners on product enhancement prioritization, go-to-market strategy, external messaging, and an excellent product experience reflecting international user insights and pain points. You will also guide international marketers in defining their local narrative, drawing upon relevant product features and new launches. Forming effective cross-functional relationships and influencing product direction and development will be essential in this role.</p><p>Know the user. Know the magic. Connect the two. At its core, marketing at Google starts with technology and ends with the user, bringing both together in unconventional ways. Our job is to demonstrate how Google&#39;s products solve the world&#39;s problems--from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can--changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.</p>",
