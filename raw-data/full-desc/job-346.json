    "description": "<p>Being a Researcher at Google means finding people in hard-to-reach places. Like finding needles in a haystack, our team of sourcers are responsible for discovering the most talented people in the world. As a Researcher on one of our functional staffing teams, you play the role of detective -- tapping into all kinds of tools and resources to uncover the best untapped talent out there. Once spotted, you engage with these passive candidates, learn about their aspirations and interests and help them connect with roles, projects and opportunities at Google. You are both scrappy and resourceful, are able to listen to what candidates have to say and then and connect them with the Google magic.</p>\n\n<p>As a Researcher on our Leadership Recruiting team, you will be tasked with building robust research strategies to identify and engage candidates. You are an analytical and resourceful individual with a passion for research and developing relationships, and have the ability to listen and understand the goals of candidates and our hiring teams.</p><p>Great just isn&#39;t good enough for our People Operations team (you probably know us better as &quot;Human Resources&quot;). Made up of equal parts HR professionals, former consultants and analysts, we&#39;re the advocates of Google&#39;s colorful culture. In People Ops, we &quot;find them, grow them, and keep them&quot; - we bring the world&#39;s most innovative people to Google and provide the programs that help them thrive. Whether recruiting the next great Googler, refining our core programs, developing talent or simply looking for ways to inject some more fun into the lives of our Googlers, we bring a data-driven approach that is reinventing the human resources field.</p>",
