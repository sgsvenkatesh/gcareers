    "description": "<p>Whether you&#39;re on a consumer product (like Gmail, Search, Maps, Chrome, Android) or a business product (Google Ads, AdSense, Google Marketing Platform, Analytics), you take part in a complete marketing experience as you lead every facet of the product&#39;s journey. From determining positioning, naming, competitive analysis, feature prioritization and external communications, you help shape the voice of the product and help it grow a consumer base. This means you work with a cross-functional team across Sales, corporate communications, legal, webmasters, product development, engineering and more. In this role, you&#39;ll be involved with product marketing strategy from beginning to end.</p><p>Google provides developers with tools and technologies, as well as education and community-oriented programs, that aim to spark innovation and inspire the development of simple, life-improving technologies and viable businesses. Developer Marketing is focused on driving the success of these technologies and programs by executing global, scalable events and creative marketing campaigns that inspire, educate and connect developers. In this role, you&#39;ll have the opportunity to shape one of Google\u2019s conferences, Google I/O. You will create experiences for attendees; empowering the developers who will shape the future of the web and mobile.</p><p>Know the user. Know the magic. Connect the two. At its core, marketing at Google starts with technology and ends with the user, bringing both together in unconventional ways. Our job is to demonstrate how Google&#39;s products solve the world&#39;s problems--from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can--changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.</p>",
