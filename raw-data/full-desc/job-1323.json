    "description": "<p>Whether you&#39;re on a consumer product (like Gmail, Search, Maps, Chrome, Android) or a business product (Google Ads, AdSense, Google Marketing Platform, Analytics), you take part in a complete marketing experience as you lead every facet of the product&#39;s journey. From determining positioning, naming, competitive analysis, feature prioritization and external communications, you help shape the voice of the product and help it grow a consumer base. This means you work with a cross-functional team across Sales, corporate communications, legal, webmasters, product development, engineering and more. In this role, you&#39;ll be involved with product marketing strategy from beginning to end.</p>\n\n\n<p>The Marketing Operations team works to inspire and enable creative work. We lead programs focused on Agency Management, Production Operations, MarTech and Business Affairs/Deal Desk. Equal parts business partners, influencers, trainers, and coaches, we have extensive experience in partner management and marketing governance, and a deep and wide understanding of the agency landscape and creative process. \n</p>\n\n\n<p>In this role, you&#39;ll be responsible for managing the workflow of agreements between marketers and our partners. You&#39;ll partner closely with our contract managers to review, analyze, draft and negotiate statements of works, license agreements, sponsorship agreements, and talent releases. As a Program Manager, you&#39;ll collaborate cross-functionally, and engage with Marketing personnel at all levels, including assisting in training new Marketing team members. Your experience will help us unlock new ways of working and enable us to develop methods of streamlining and improving internal workflows and processes.</p><p>Know the user. Know the magic. Connect the two. At its core, marketing at Google starts with technology and ends with the user, bringing both together in unconventional ways. Our job is to demonstrate how Google&#39;s products solve the world&#39;s problems--from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can--changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.</p>",
