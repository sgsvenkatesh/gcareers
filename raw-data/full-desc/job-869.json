    "description": "<p>Financial Analysts ensure that Google makes sound financial decisions. As a Financial Analyst, your work, whether it&#39;s modeling business scenarios or tracking performance metrics, is used by our leaders to make strategic company decisions. A master juggler working on multiple projects at a time, you are focused on the details while finding creative ways to take on big picture challenges.</p>\n\n<p>We are looking for someone with the analytical rigor and strategic thinking to drive our business and business generation forward. This is an exciting role that provides full finance support to business partners as well as offering scope for leadership of individual analytical projects. You will work in close partnership with highly talented finance colleagues from across the region and consult on planning, reporting and decision support for the wide range of activities that acquire, delight and retain our users and advertisers and employees (e.g., investment strategies for products, key market drivers or business profitability and resource allocation).\n</p>\n\n<p>You are an analyst who wants to make your mark on a successful and growing team, and who wants to further develop already strong business partnering skills. You are an excellent communicator who enjoys collaborating with people who possess a diverse set of talents. You are a strong time manager and are able to prioritize effectively while creating space for original thinking and thoughtful analysis to support our executives.</p><p>The name Google came from &quot;googol,&quot; a mathematical term for the number 1 followed by 100 zeros. And nobody at Google loves big numbers like the Finance team when providing in depth analysis on all manner of strategic decisions across Google products. From developing forward-thinking analysis to generating management reports to scaling our automated financial processes, the Finance organization is an important partner and advisor to the business.</p>",
