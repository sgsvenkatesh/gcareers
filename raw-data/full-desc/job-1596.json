Your projects often span offices, time zones and hemispheres, and it&#39;s your job to keep all the players coordinated on the project&#39;s progress and deadlines.</p>\n\n<p>Join Google\u2019s Go Open Source Strategy Team to build a stronger bridge between Google and the Go community through meaningful and highly relevant communication and event engagement. As the Go DevRel Engagement Manager, you will create content and event programs that will foster discussion between Google and the community about Google\u2019s technical and community Go updates, amplify the Go community\u2019s successes, and highlight how Go is best on Google Cloud.\n</p>\n\n<p>In this role, you will excel at understanding Google\u2019s and the community\u2019s information needs and the communication style that resonates best. You are metrics-oriented and have great success driving authentic engagement through social, blogs, and events.
