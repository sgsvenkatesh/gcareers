You plan requirements with internal customers and usher projects through the entire project lifecycle. This includes managing project schedules, identifying risks and clearly communicating them to project stakeholders. You&#39;re equally at home explaining your team&#39;s analyses and recommendations to executives as you are discussing the technical trade-offs in product development with engineers.</p>\n\n\n<p>There is always more information out there, and the Research and Machine Intelligence team has a never-ending quest to find it and make it accessible. As part of the AI Healthcare team, our focus is on high impact problems that have recently become tractable with the advent of Deep Learning.\n</p>\n\n\n<p>As a Health IT System Engineer, you&#39;ll be an integral team member. Your understanding of the healthcare landscape, requirements, and challenges will enable you to work hand-in-hand with our product and research teams to design and develop scalable solutions and take them to market. The aim is to deliver advanced system engineering, standup, ETL, and implementation for the team\u2019s studies. You will also be interfacing with our Google Cloud Platform team as a liaison with our product and research teams to enable high throughput dataflows.</p><p>There is always more information out there, and the Research and Machine Intelligence team has a never-ending quest to find it and make it accessible.
