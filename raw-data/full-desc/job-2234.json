    "description": "<p>Whether you&#39;re on a consumer product (like Gmail, Search, Maps, Chrome, Android) or a business product (Google Ads, AdSense, Google Marketing Platform, Analytics), you take part in a complete marketing experience as you lead every facet of the product&#39;s journey. From determining positioning, naming, competitive analysis, feature prioritization and external communications, you help shape the voice of the product and help it grow a loyal consumer base. This means you work with a cross-functional team across sales, corporate communications, legal, webmasters, product development, engineering and more. In this role, you&#39;ll be involved with product marketing strategy from beginning to end.</p>\n\n<p>As a Brand Marketing Manager you will have the exciting opportunity to work on a visible part of Google&#39;s brand that aims to surprise, delight, and inspire curiosity as well as relay our brand values to billions of people around the world. You&#39;ll also have the unique opportunity to work on both brand and product marketing every day. </p>\n\n<p>You&#39;ll play a vital role in taking Doodles marketing to the next level by helping build marketing amplifications around important global Doodle launches (e.g., partnerships with both internal product/content teams or external influencers and organizations) as well as helping build a more robust Doodles social and communications strategy. You will also be responsible for managing various marketing and communications aspects of the day-to-day Doodle process, which includes extensive work with marketers and cross-functional teams around the world. You&#39;re self-motivated, strategic and creative with proven execution and writing skills. You also have an unwavering passion for celebrating diverse cultures and building an emotional connection with users everywhere.</p><p>Know the user. Know the magic. Connect the two. At its core, marketing at Google starts with technology and ends with the user, bringing both together in unconventional ways. Our job is to demonstrate how Google&#39;s products solve the world&#39;s problems--from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can--changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.</p>",
