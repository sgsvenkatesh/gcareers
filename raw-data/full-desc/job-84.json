As a member of this team, you will help improve the buying process for Googlers and be responsible for transforming how purchases are made at Google by designing procurement processes for indirect goods and services within Marketing, Consulting, Temps/Vendors/Contractors (TVCs), and IT services. </p>\n\n\n<p>As a Global Process Manager, you will design buying, supplier selection, contracting, and purchase order (PO) creation processes. You will also work directly with businesses to achieve transactional efficiency and decrease end-to-end cycle times through centralized processes. Additionally, you will identify opportunities to provide centralized, outsourced support of the procurement process to business stakeholders, develop business requirements to ensure the procurement system transformation supports buying processes, and provide industry expertise and insights on procurement best practices, specifically category management, contracting, and buy channel optimization.</p><p>The name Google came from &quot;googol,&quot; a mathematical term for the number 1 followed by 100 zeros. And nobody at Google loves big numbers like the Finance team when providing in depth analysis on all manner of strategic decisions across Google products. From developing forward-thinking analysis to generating management reports to scaling our automated financial processes, the Finance organization is an important partner and advisor to the business.</p>",
