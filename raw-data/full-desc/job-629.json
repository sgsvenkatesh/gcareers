    "description": "<p>As the Creative Director for Retail and Google Store, you&#39;ll bring excellent visual, design, written, and experiential acumen to our Google-made devices and accessories at retail and the Google Store. You will be responsible for creating and shaping the visual language, marketing communications and end-to-end creative story for how Google\u2019s hardware products and services are presented across different retail channels and formats. You will drive innovation across numerous retail environments and provide creative guidance to our third-party retail partners on how to best bring Google hardware products to life.\n</p>\n\n<p>In this role, you will partner with a number of cross-functional teams at Google, including Global Hardware Marketing, Sales, Communications, the Google Store, Product Management and Engineering. You&#39;ll also work directly with a team of internal creative resources to realize creative concepts and inspire a team of vendor partners by sharing ideas and developing effective solutions to generate multiple creative concepts. Additionally, you will inspire agencies to do their best creative work.</p><p>Know the user. Know the magic. Connect the two. At its core, marketing at Google starts with technology and ends with the user, bringing both together in unconventional ways. Our job is to demonstrate how Google&#39;s products solve the world&#39;s problems--from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can--changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.</p>",
