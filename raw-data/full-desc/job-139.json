In this role, you\u2019ll combine expert project management skills with a passion for user experience to help your team improve the designs of products that are used by billions of users. You\u2019ll work cross-functionally and collaborate with managers, designers and engineering teams to plan projects, define milestones, assign resources, assess risks, and help projects meet deadlines. \n</p>\n\n<p>As a UX Program Manager, you will also manage all project-related communications to team members, executives and other stakeholders. You are a master planner and a flexible project manager who can balance multiple projects.</p><p>Users come first at Google.
