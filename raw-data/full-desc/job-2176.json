    "description": "<p>Analytical Linguists work across Google to drive improvements in quality, classification, information structure, and natural language understanding and generation. As an Analytical Linguist you will work both on complex projects spanning multiple products, groups, and disciplines, and on tightly focused efforts to produce specific product components or answer specific research questions. Analytical Linguists work in many different areas and arrive with a wide variety of skills\u2014your specialization might involve natural language processing and understanding, phonology, phonetics, syntax, semantics, ontology, program management, human subject research, experimental design, statistics, corpus linguistics, large scale data acquisition, or any combination. This team is part of some of the most groundbreaking and exciting work at Google. It&#39;s our goal to use insights from linguistics and related fields to constantly improve our products.</p>\n\n\n<p>Growing the Knowledge Graph requires the development of knowledge models describing how entities relate to one another.\n</p>\n\n\n<p>As a Linguist/Ontologist on the Geo team, you will analyze graph structures and content, develop new semantic representations, and work with providers and consumers of data to guide the development and usage of knowledge structures to improve entity accessibility and enable automated reasoning. You will also use a variety of semantic modeling techniques, judging tradeoffs between formality and usability and deciding when to borrow from an existing ontology and when to develop new structures.</p><p>The Geo team builds the most accurate, comprehensive, and useful maps for our users. More than a billion people rely on Google Maps services to explore the world and navigate their daily lives. That includes sailing down the Amazon river, choosing where to get a bite of pizza, flying over a 3D version of New York City and saving time commuting. <br><br>Geo helps merchants get their businesses on Google, and more than a million developers use the power of Google Maps to enhance their apps and websites. They are solving complex computer science problems, designing beautiful and intuitive product experiences and improving the accuracy of our geo data, all in order to plot a course for the future of mapping.</p>",
