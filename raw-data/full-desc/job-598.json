    "description": "<p>At Google, our philosophy is build it, break it and then rebuild it better. That thinking is at the core of how we approach testing at Google. Unlike roles with similar names at the other companies, Test Engineers at Google aren&#39;t manual testers -- you write scripts to automate testing and create tools so developers can test their own code. As a Test Engineer, you navigate Google&#39;s massive codebase, identify weak spots and constantly design better and creative ways to break software and identify potential problems. You&#39;ll have a huge impact on the quality of Google&#39;s growing suite of products and services.</p>\n\n<p>As a System Test Engineer, you&#39;ll create tools and setups to validate the latest features in consumer audio and video technologies and design novel ways to test system audio responses under different conditions, including different sets of inputs, room acoustics, speaker positioning and ambient noise. You will develop tools and automation to scale testing to a variety of products and analyze and test sensor interface of systems for efficiency and scaling. Additionally, you will, set up, operate and explore audio and video test equipment and methodologies and work with developers on the edge of Audio/Video/Sensor engineering technologies and provide feedback to system designers and product leads</p><p>Google&#39;s mission is to organize the world&#39;s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Our Hardware team researches, designs, and develops new technologies and hardware to make our user&#39;s interaction with computing faster, more powerful, and seamless. Whether finding new ways to capture and sense the world around us, advancing form factors, or improving interaction methods, our Hardware team is making people&#39;s lives better through technology.</p>",
