You enjoy problem solving and strategy and seek out new ways to solve complex finance operational challenges, finding the right balance between risk, speed and cost.</p><p>The name Google came from &quot;googol,&quot; a mathematical term for the number 1 followed by 100 zeros. And nobody at Google loves big numbers like the Finance team when providing in depth analysis on all manner of strategic decisions across Google products. From developing forward-thinking analysis to generating management reports to scaling our automated financial processes, the Finance organization is an important partner and advisor to the business.</p>",
