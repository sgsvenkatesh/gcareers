    "description": "<p>Our PeopleDev team works hard to ensure every Googler has access to the resources they need to become their best personal and professional selves. We leverage tools, technology, and innovative formats to scale learning and support Googlers at all stages of their careers \u2014 from Noogler Orientation, to manager training, to leadership development, and more. We have four key beliefs about learning \u2014 that it is personal, social, a process, and happens in real life \u2014 and we infuse these beliefs throughout the wide array of learning and development opportunities at Google. As a PeopleDev team member, you&#39;ll always be thinking about new ways to help others grow, and you share a passion for empowering Googlers to unlock their full potential.</p>\n\n\n<p>You\u2019d be joining the Learning Operations team, which works globally to advance scale, efficiency, and to improve the learning and developmental experiences of Googlers. \n</p>\n\n\n<p>As the Learning Ops Data and Insights Manager, you\u2019ll be responsible for ensuring PeopleDev has the data, insights, and capabilities to understand whether our learning experiences are achieving our key metrics (e.g., efficiency, quality, impact). You will work with a variety of stakeholders across both PeopleDev and People Operations (POps) to ensure they have the data they need, through self-service capabilities or direct support, to make Google a place to learn and grow. As you will be responsible for standing up this team and partnering with the Head of Learning Operations to set the strategy of data support across PeopleDev, you will be comfortable in an ambiguous environment and will want to work on and solve complex issues by working with and through partners and stakeholders. The role will continue to evolve and refine how we measure the impact of our Learning and Development programs and interventions, operations, and talent management capabilities.</p><p>Great just isn&#39;t good enough for our People Operations team (you probably know us better as &quot;\u0098Human Resources&quot;). Made up of equal parts HR professionals, former consultants and analysts, we&#39;re the advocates of Google&#39;s colorful culture. In People Ops, we &quot;find them, grow them, and keep them&quot;\u009d - we bring the world&#39;s most innovative people to Google and provide the programs that help them thrive. Whether recruiting the next great Googler, refining our core programs, developing talent or simply looking for ways to inject some more fun into the lives of our Googlers, we bring a data-driven approach that is reinventing the human resources field.</p>",
