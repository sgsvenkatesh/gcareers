    "description": "<p>Google accountants are a savvy bunch who handle the core accounting responsibilities at Google. As a member of this team, you know your accounting principles and the full accounting process end to end. You&#39;ll advise on financial reports required by governmental regulations, and you&#39;ll review, analyze, and interpret financial and budgetary reports -- and all this sounds like fun to you. Every day is a new challenge, and you&#39;re continually looking for ways to help our team get better at what we do, in the most efficient way possible. A team player at heart, you collaborate with our global team, advocate best practices and roll up your sleeves to pitch in when it&#39;s all hands on deck. You move fast while keeping your attention to detail, and you tap into your problem-solving skills to support Google&#39;s business objectives.</p>\n\n<p>The Cloud Business Finance team helps ensure contracting policies are executed accurately, keeps Finance leaders informed on market trends, and timely reports on growth and expenses. Within our team, the Operations Program Manager will focus on supporting business initiatives, including product launches, currency/FOP expansion, and acquisitions. You will work closely with the Cloud business to support and directly contribute to its growth, working collaborating with Product, Engineering, and other Finance teams to manage financial risk and develop and maintain scalable processes to support Cloud accounting and Sales compliance. In this role, you will work as port of a team and use excellent technical skills to deliver on deadlines and produce excellent work.</p><p>The name Google came from &quot;googol,&quot; a mathematical term for the number 1 followed by 100 zeros. And nobody at Google loves big numbers like the Finance team when providing in depth analysis on all manner of strategic decisions across Google products. From developing forward-thinking analysis to generating management reports to scaling our automated financial processes, the Finance organization is an important partner and advisor to the business.</p>",
