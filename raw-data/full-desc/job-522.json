    "description": "<p>Our computational challenges are so big, complex and unique we can&#39;t just purchase off-the-shelf hardware, we&#39;ve got to make it ourselves. Your team designs and builds the hardware, software and networking technologies that power all of Google&#39;s services. As a Power Engineer, you design and build the systems that are the heart of the world&#39;s largest and most powerful computing infrastructure. You develop from the lowest levels of circuit design to large system design and see those systems all the way through to high volume manufacturing. Your work has the potential to shape the machinery that goes into our cutting-edge data centers affecting millions of Google users.<br><br>As a key member of the team, you manage projects in multiple areas with your expertise. You also monitor the performance of vendors working on projects and evaluate new technologies.</p>\n\n\n<p>As a Power Engineer on the chip team, you will be working to architect power solutions for SoCs in advanced technology nodes. You will define and drive the power management and optimization methodology from architecture to implementation and sign-off. You will define the requirements for power management IPs and be responsible for the design, integration and post-silicon validation of the IP. You will set power budgets for use cases and provide power estimation for blocks and full chip, and you will collaborate with cross-functional teams to drive power reduction across the platform.</p><p>Behind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technical Infrastructure team to keep it running. From developing and maintaining our data centers to building the next generation of Google platforms, we make Google&#39;s product portfolio possible. We&#39;re proud to be our engineers&#39; engineers and love voiding warranties by taking things apart so we can rebuild them. We&#39;re always on call to keep our networks up and running, ensuring our users have the best and fastest experience possible.</p>",
