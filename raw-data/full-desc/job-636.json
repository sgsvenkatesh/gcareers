    "description": "<p>At Google, data drives all of our decision-making, and our HR organization is no exception. The People Analytics team acts as an internal innovation lab, using analytical approaches to make sure Google continues to be a great place to work. The team provides critical support to the business around issues of organizational health and is responsible for not just taking the pulse of our Googlers, but harnessing Googler feedback to drive change for the better. As an analyst you&#39;ll be detail-oriented and conscientious, analytical and curious. You&#39;re a strong problem-solver, who uses both quantitative and qualitative methods to get things done. And on top of it all, you&#39;re someone who wonders &quot;What if?&quot; and then seeks out the solution.</p>\n\n\n<p>As Head of Strategy Planning and Analysis, you&#39;ll play a central role in supporting execution and strategy of our product area staffing teams. In this role you will draw insights from analytics that will influence our product areas talent acquisition strategy, business operations and organizational construct. You will work across multiple organizations and leadership teams to develop a wholistic perspective on human capital strategic areas (e.g. compensation, talent acquisition programs and leadership structure/capability).</p><p>Great just isn&#39;t good enough for our People Operations team (you probably know us better as &quot;Human Resources&quot;). Made up of equal parts HR professionals, former consultants and analysts, we&#39;re the advocates of Google&#39;s colorful culture. In People Ops, we &quot;find them, grow them, and keep them&quot; - we bring the world&#39;s most innovative people to Google and provide the programs that help them thrive. Whether recruiting the next great Googler, refining our core programs, developing talent or simply looking for ways to inject some more fun into the lives of our Googlers, we bring a data-driven approach that is reinventing the human resources field.</p>",
