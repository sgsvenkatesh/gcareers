    "description": "<p>Google&#39;s projects, like our users, span the globe and require managers to keep the big picture in focus while being able to dive into the unique engineering challenges we face daily. As a Technical Program Manager at Google, you lead complex, multi-disciplinary engineering projects using your engineering expertise. You plan requirements with internal customers and usher projects through the entire project lifecycle. This includes managing project schedules, identifying risks and clearly communicating them to project stakeholders. You&#39;re equally at home explaining your team&#39;s analyses and recommendations to executives as you are discussing the technical trade-offs in product development with engineers.</p>\n\n<p>As a key member of the engineering team, you will work closely with software engineers, product managers, partners, and the open source community to get high-quality products and new features built, tested, and released on time for both consumers and Hardware partners. You&#39;ll coordinate lots of fast-changing, moving parts and get them to come together as a product. These include Software and Hardware schedules as well as managing partner release needs. You&#39;ll need excellent communication skills as the center of the universe for all questions about release schedules, quality, and progress updates. You will be responsible for identifying and managing risks, making sound judgments about quality, and stopping (or speeding up) production at the right time.</p><p>Google is and always will be an engineering company. We hire people with a broad set of technical skills who are ready to take on some of technology&#39;s greatest challenges and make an impact on millions, if not billions, of users. At Google, engineers not only revolutionize search, they routinely work on massive scalability and storage solutions, large-scale applications and entirely new platforms for developers around the world. From Google Ads to Chrome, Android to YouTube, Social to Local, Google engineers are changing the world one technological achievement after another.</p>",
