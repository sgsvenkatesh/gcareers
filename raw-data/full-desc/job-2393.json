    "description": "<p>Google&#39;s projects, like our users, span the globe and require managers to keep the big picture in focus while being able to dive into the unique engineering challenges we face daily. As a Technical Program Manager at Google, you lead complex, multi-disciplinary engineering projects using your engineering expertise. You plan requirements with internal customers and usher projects through the entire project lifecycle. This includes managing project schedules, identifying risks and clearly communicating them to project stakeholders. You&#39;re equally at home explaining your team&#39;s analyses and recommendations to executives as you are discussing the technical trade-offs in product development with engineers.</p>\n\n<p>Within the Android team, you will own release schedules in our fast-paced environment, and work closely with software engineers, QA, product managers and field testers to get high-quality products and new features built, tested, and released on time. You will coordinate lots of fast-changing, moving parts and still get them to come together as a product. You&#39;ll need excellent communication skills to be the go-to person for all questions about release schedules, quality and progress updates. You will be responsible for identifying and managing risks, making sound judgments about quality and stopping (or speeding up) production at the right time.</p><p>Making the world&#39;s information universally accessible and useful doesn&#39;t stop at the desktop. The Mobile team builds tools to get you the information you need no matter where you are. Android has become the world&#39;s most popular mobile ecosystem, powering billions of devices, from smartphones to tablets, watches to TVs and everything in between. Whether adding to the core Android experience, forging new markets for digital content, creating immersive and portable versions of our products or managing relationships with a global community of developers, the Mobile team is giving you Google on the go.</p>",
