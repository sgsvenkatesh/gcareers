    "description": "<p>Google engineers develop the next-generation technologies that change how users connect, explore, and interact with information and one another. As a member of an extraordinarily creative, motivated and talented team, you develop new products that are used by millions of people. We need our engineers to be versatile and passionate to take on new problems as we continue to push technology forward. If you get excited about building new things and working across discipline lines, then our team might be your next career step.</p>\n\n<p>You&#39;ll be part of a Research and Development team developing high performance and low power hardware and software to enable acceleration in machine learning.\n</p>\n\n<p>You&#39;ll work closely with ASIC Design and Software Engineers to verify complex digital design systems. You will apply your UVM, SystemVerilog coding and problem-solving skills on multiple active projects. You will be responsible for full verification life-cycle, including planning, building new test environments, enhancing verification methodology, debug and coverage closure.</p><p>Google&#39;s mission is to organize the world&#39;s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Our Hardware team researches, designs, and develops new technologies and hardware to make our user&#39;s interaction with computing faster, more powerful, and seamless. Whether finding new ways to capture and sense the world around us, advancing form factors, or improving interaction methods, our Hardware team is making people&#39;s lives better through technology.</p>",
