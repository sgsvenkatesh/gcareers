    "description": "<p>Our marketing campaign projects, like our users, span the globe and require managers to keep the big picture in focus. As part of the Global Marketing team, you plan requirements with internal customers and/or external agencies and usher projects through the entire project lifecycle. Your projects often span offices, time zones and hemispheres, and it&#39;s your job to keep all the players coordinated on the project&#39;s progress and deadlines.</p>\n\n\n<p>As a Retail Producer, you will provide strategic program management and executional leadership for Google&#39;s Retail Marketing team. Your key responsibilities will include execution of global retail creative initiatives, product launches and campaign refreshes. You\u2019ll work collaboratively with cross-functional, regional and country teams on strategy alignment, go-to-market planning and execution across the various programs. Our team brings the Google brand and hardware devices to life in retail around the globe. We\u2019re a dynamic team of go-to-market specialists, retail advocates, partner marketers, experience designers, demo experience experts, production managers and producers whose mission is to fundamentally change how people discover and explore Google products.</p><p>Know the user. Know the magic. Connect the two. At its core, marketing at Google starts with technology and ends with the user, bringing both together in unconventional ways. Our job is to demonstrate how Google&#39;s products solve the world&#39;s problems--from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can--changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.</p>",
