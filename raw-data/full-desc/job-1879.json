    "description": "<p>Google&#39;s projects, like our users, span the globe and require managers to keep the big picture in focus. As a Program Manager at Google, you lead complex, multi-disciplinary projects. You plan requirements with internal customers and usher projects through the entire project lifecycle. This includes managing project schedules, identifying risks and clearly communicating goals to project stakeholders. Your projects often span offices, time zones and hemispheres, and it&#39;s your job to keep all the players coordinated on the project&#39;s progress and deadlines.</p>\n\n<p>The Chrome and Chrome OS Enterprise products are offered in many geographies and industries, each of which presents a challenging environment to operate in from a regulatory perspective. As a Program Manager on the Chrome and Chrome OS Enterprise team, you will work with cross-functional teams from Product, Legal, Engineering, Sales and Marketing to ensure our products are compliant with these regulations (such as GDPR, HIPAA, FIPS, etc.) and that customers develop a deep sense of trust in Chrome to handle their needs in compliance and data privacy. You will be involved in building features, putting together processes, documenting product gaps and working with Marketing to showcase our narratives in front of our customers.</p><p>The web is what you make of it and our team is helping the world make more of the web. From open-source pros to user-experience extraordinaires, we develop products that help users connect, communicate and collaborate with others. Our consumer products and cloud platforms are giving millions of users at homes, businesses, universities and nonprofits around the world the tools that shape their web experience -- and changing the way they think about computing.</p>",
