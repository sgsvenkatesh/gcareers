    "description": "<p>Design and user experience (UX) are at the forefront of everything we do. The job of an Interaction Designer is to envision how people experience our products and bring that vision to life in a way that feels inspired, refined and even magical. In an Interaction Designer role, you\u2019ll take on complex tasks and transform them into intuitive, accessible and easy-to-use designs for billions of people around the world\u2014from the first-time user to the sophisticated expert. Achieving this goal requires collaboration with teams of Designers, Researchers, Engineers and Product Managers throughout the design process\u2014from creating user flows and wireframes to building user interface mockups and prototypes. At each stage, you will anticipate what our users need, advocate for them and ensure that the final product surprises and delights them.</p>\n\n\n<p>As Physical UX Design Lead at Home/Nest, you will be responsible for defining how people experience and use our products through physical interfaces. You will be able to articulate a coherent vision for a product\u2019s physical interface, provide exhaustive specifications for its implementation, and lead intensive, cross-team collaboration to make that vision a tangible reality for our customers. You will be comfortable crafting a coherent product experience in an environment where requirements and constraints evolve and are defined over many design iterations. Additionally, you will ensure that customers\u2019 interactions with our products promote brand-elevating experiences in every way.</p><p>Google&#39;s mission is to organize the world&#39;s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Our Hardware team researches, designs, and develops new technologies and hardware to make our user&#39;s interaction with computing faster, more powerful, and seamless. Whether finding new ways to capture and sense the world around us, advancing form factors, or improving interaction methods, our Hardware team is making people&#39;s lives better through technology.</p>",
