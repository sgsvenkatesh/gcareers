    "description": "<p>Passionate people are everywhere at Google. In Developer Relations, we are excited to collaborate and connect with the communities that love technology as much as we do. Part community manager and part developer advocate, Developer Programs Engineers collaborate with developers at conferences and online, and advocate for developers interests internally at Google. Not afraid to be hands-on, you write sample code and client libraries as well as participate in developer forums and support queues to troubleshoot and debug coding problems developers encounter. Internally, you work with product engineering teams to improve our products by conveying feedback from developers, reviewing API designs, and testing new features. Chrome, Android, App Engine, HTML5, and our core G Suite and Ads APIs are just some of the platforms you promote and support.</p>\n\n<p>As a Developer Programs Engineer (DPE) on the DevRel Infrastructure team you&#39;ll amplify the efforts of other DPEs and Tech Writers. You will ensure Google&#39;s developer experience is great from end to end. You&#39;ll build user-facing features for Google\u2019s developer documentation Content Management System (CMS), create reusable events infrastructure, and improve discovery and global accessibility of Google developer content.</p><p>We strive to organize the world&#39;s information to make it universally accessible and useful, but we know that relevance means something different to each person. The Social team recognizes that great information is more than pages -- it&#39;s also about relationships. We want all of Google&#39;s products to reflect something personal, and we&#39;re dedicated to making your Google experience centered around you.</p>",
