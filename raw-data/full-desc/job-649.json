    "description": "<p>Kubernetes (K8S) is a portable, extensible open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support and tools are widely available. Google open-sourced the Kubernetes project in 2014. Kubernetes builds upon a decade and a half of experience that Google has with running production workloads at scale, combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.\n</p>\n\n<p>Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) is a hosted version of Kubernetes running on Google Cloud Platform providing extra layer of automation and zero devops to allow for frictionless use of K8S.\n</p>\n\n<p>While growing fast, container adoption is still in its early stages and many technical areas remain immature. We need visionary, execution-focused technical leaders to help shape the future of cloud computing and to help us expand our already sizable effort exponentially. As the Principal Engineer, you will be building cutting edge cloud technology that is already powering a number of the biggest, innovative companies and customers of Google Cloud worldwide.</p><p>Google Cloud helps millions of employees and organizations empower their employees, serve their customers, and build what\u2019s next for their business \u2014 all with technology built in the cloud. Our products are engineered for security, reliability and scalability, running the full stack from infrastructure to applications to devices and hardware. And our teams are dedicated to helping our customers \u2014 developers, small and large businesses, educational institutions and government agencies \u2014 see the benefits of our technology come to life.</p>",
