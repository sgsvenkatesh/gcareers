    "description": "<p>Google&#39;s projects, like our users, span the globe and require managers to keep the big picture in focus. As a Privacy Compliance Program Manager at Google, you lead complex, multi-disciplinary projects. You plan requirements with internal customers and usher projects through the entire project lifecycle. This includes managing project schedules, identifying risks and clearly communicating goals to project stakeholders. Your projects often span offices, time zones and hemispheres, and it&#39;s your job to keep all the players coordinated on the project&#39;s progress and deadlines.</p>\n\n<p>As Google grows, we continue to look for ways to better understand and manage compliance with other intersecting obligations, both to our users and with respect to regulatory and legal requirements. The Privacy Compliance team provides assurance that Google\u2019s privacy program is applied consistently and comprehensively, meets our regulatory obligations and improves our users\u2019 trust.\n</p>\n\n<p>In this role, you&#39;ll use your experience in program management to help scale our privacy compliance efforts. You care deeply about user trust, you have excellent organizational program management skills, and can bridge the gap between Engineering and Legal teams. You&#39;ll interact with Product, Privacy and Compliance teams across the company and with the Privacy and Data Protection Office to develop deep insights into the mechanics of how Google Product teams incorporate privacy-by-design into their engineering lifecycles.\n</p>\n\n<p>You will create and drive a program to oversee privacy control governance and look for ways to improve our ability to measure and report on effectiveness. You will work closely with cross-functional teams to analyze, define and verify current and future control solutions to manage risk across Google\u2019s products and services. You will also drive execution of remediation plans when control gaps are identified.</p><p>Behind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technical Infrastructure team to keep it running. From developing and maintaining our data centers to building the next generation of Google platforms, we make Google&#39;s product portfolio possible. We&#39;re proud to be our engineers&#39; engineers and love voiding warranties by taking things apart so we can rebuild them. We&#39;re always on call to keep our networks up and running, ensuring our users have the best and fastest experience possible.</p>",
