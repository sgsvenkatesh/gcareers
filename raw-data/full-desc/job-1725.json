    "description": "<p>Passionate people are everywhere at Google. In Developer Relations, we are excited to collaborate and connect with the communities that love technology as much as we do. Part community manager and part developer advocate, Developer Programs Engineers collaborate with developers at conferences and online, and advocate for developers interests internally at Google. Not afraid to be hands-on, you write sample code and client libraries as well as participate in developer forums and support queues to troubleshoot and debug coding problems developers encounter. Internally, you work with product engineering teams to improve our products by conveying feedback from developers, reviewing API designs, and testing new features. Chrome, Android, App Engine, HTML5, and our core G Suite and Ads APIs are just some of the platforms you promote and support.</p>\n\n\n<p>As a Developer Programs Engineer (DPE) on the Developer Relations (DevRel) Infrastructure team you&#39;ll amplify the efforts of other DPEs and Tech Writers and ensure the Google&#39;s developer experience is great from end to end. Additionally, you&#39;ll build user-facing features for Google\u2019s developer documentation Content Management System (CMS), create reusable events infrastructure, and improve discovery and global accessibility of Google developer content.</p><p>Google is and always will be an engineering company. We hire people with a broad set of technical skills who are ready to take on some of technology&#39;s greatest challenges and make an impact on millions, if not billions, of users. At Google, engineers not only revolutionize search, they routinely work on massive scalability and storage solutions, large-scale applications and entirely new platforms for developers around the world. From Google Ads to Chrome, Android to YouTube, Social to Local, Google engineers are changing the world one technological achievement after another.</p>",
