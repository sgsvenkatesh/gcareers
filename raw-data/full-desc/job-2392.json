    "description": "<p>The Online Partnerships Group (OPG) is a partner-focused organization that prides itself in providing great service, in creating innovative solutions, and most importantly, in having amazing people. We value having an open, inclusive and collaborative culture, where Googlers feel supported and able to do their best work. In offices around the globe, we foster and celebrate an environment where all team members feel welcomed and respected. OPG partners with online publishers and app developers around the world to grow their businesses using our portfolio of products including the AdSense, AdMob, and Google Ad Manager platforms. We offer a solutions-based approach across advertising, analytics, and site or app design, and pride ourselves in finding new opportunities for our partners to better engage users and advertisers. Over a million web publishers and app developers rely on our solution globally, and ultimately, we&#39;re proud to enable Google to be one of the foremost funders of digital content in the world.</p>\n\n<p>The Publisher Intelligence team is a business analyst team responsible for helping OPG make the best decisions possible using data. As an Analyst on the Publisher Intelligence team, you will be responsible for scoping, initiating and delivering on analytical projects, such as modeling publisher behavior, creating complex SQL workflows and evaluating the impact of projects and products via statistical methods. This requires not only deep analytical and modeling skills but also the ability to develop strategic recommendations based on analysis and communicate and operationalize them (often in conjunction with various other cross-functional stakeholders). \n</p>\n\n<p>Your role is not about simply grinding out numbers; it is about building new business processes based on data and models to increase efficiency and improve customer satisfaction. You will work in a collaborative role working closely with the various teams within OPG and throughout Google to drive the business decisions that will make our partners more successful.</p><p>Google helps our partners find better ways to reach their audiences and manage their digital businesses. In return, our partners provide great content for our products, and they syndicate Google products to enhance their sites and apps. Global Partnerships team members expand and support these relationships by continually finding new opportunities and solving technical problems for our partners. The wider Global Partnerships team includes a variety of different organizations, including CorpDev, Emerging Business Development, Strategy and Operations, Google for Startups, Area 120 and our Display Advertising Business.</p>",
