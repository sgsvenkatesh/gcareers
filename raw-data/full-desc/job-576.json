    "description": "<p>Whether you&#39;re on a consumer product (like Gmail, Search, Maps, Chrome, Android. Google Hardware) or a business product (Google Ads, AdSense, DoubleClick, Analytics), you take part in a complete marketing experience as you lead every facet of the product&#39;s journey. From determining positioning, naming, competitive analysis, feature prioritization and external communications, you help shape the voice of the product and help it grow a loyal consumer base. In this role, you&#39;ll be involved with product marketing strategy from beginning to end.\n</p>\n\n<p>As the Lead Product Marketing Manager on the Phone and Accessories Marketing team, you will be a member of the core team responsible for one of Google\u2019s most important hardware products. You will be responsible for overseeing our product marketing efforts, focusing on the next generation of smartphones. You\u2019ll work closely with key stakeholders to define positioning and messaging while focusing on awareness, engagement and retention. You will work closely with strategic external partners as well as cross-functional stakeholders across Product, Business Development &amp; Sales, Retail, Legal, Public Relations and the Regional Marketing Teams.</p><p>Know the user. Know the magic. Connect the two. At its core, marketing at Google starts with technology and ends with the user, bringing both together in unconventional ways. Our job is to demonstrate how Google&#39;s products solve the world&#39;s problems--from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can--changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.</p>",
