    "description": "<p>Google&#39;s custom-designed equipment makes up one of the largest and most powerful computing infrastructures in the world. The Manufacturing Operations team is responsible for providing the manufacturing capability to deliver this state-of-the-art physical infrastructure. As a Manufacturing Engineer, you evaluate the product designs and create the processes, tools and procedures behind Google\u2019s powerful search technology. When vendors build parts for our infrastructure, you\u2019re right there alongside ensuring manufacturing processes are repeatable and controlled. You collaborate with Commodity Managers and Design Engineers to determine Google\u2019s infrastructure needs and product specifications. Your work ensures the various pieces of Google\u2019s infrastructure fit together perfectly and keep our systems humming along smoothly for a seamless user experience.</p>\n\n\n<p>As a Semiconductor Component Supplier Quality Engineer, you will join the team responsible for setting and managing the quality and reliability standards for our Semiconductor (i.e., Timing, Logic, Power IC, Microcontroller, Passive) technology across Google. You will bring experience in quality and reliability and a track record of improving the quality of Semiconductor IC\u2019s during New Product Introduction (NPI), as well as maintaining it throughout its life cycle. You will work hands-on and have involvement in the tools and techniques used to assess product quality and reliability. You have effective partner management skills and a passion for sifting through data and using it to drive design or manufacturing process improvements.</p><p>Behind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technical Infrastructure team to keep it running. From developing and maintaining our data centers to building the next generation of Google platforms, we make Google&#39;s product portfolio possible. We&#39;re proud to be our engineers&#39; engineers and love voiding warranties by taking things apart so we can rebuild them.
