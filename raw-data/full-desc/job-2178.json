    "description": "<p>Design and user experience (UX) are at the forefront of everything we do. The job of an Interaction Designer is to envision how people experience our products and bring that vision to life in a way that feels inspired, refined and even magical. In an Interaction Designer role, you\u2019ll take on complex tasks and transform them into intuitive, accessible and easy-to-use designs for billions of people around the world\u2014from the first-time user to the sophisticated expert. Achieving this goal requires collaboration with teams of Designers, Researchers, Engineers and Product Managers throughout the design process\u2014from creating user flows and wireframes to building user interface mockups and prototypes. At each stage, you will anticipate what our users need, advocate for them and ensure that the final product surprises and delights them.</p>\n\n\n<p>In this role, you\u2019ll be responsible for designing experiences across all of Nest\u2019s camera products. These include Nest Cams, Nest Cam IQs, and Nest Hello. You\u2019ll work closely with cross-functional peers to create innovative new experiences in the camera space. Additionally, you\u2019ll collaborate with our algorithms team to define and design new machine perception based features.\n</p>\n\n\n<p>As a UX Designer, you will manage and lead feature development across Nest\u2019s portfolio of cameras. You will be able to navigate ambiguity and contribute to early product definition. You will also be able to create elegant design solutions within a fast moving, agile environment, combining strengths across disciplines to create a compelling and effective point of view. Additionally, you will bring a mix of great visual aesthetic with an ability to understand how to make a complex product feel simple and intuitive. You should have an inspiring portfolio, great design sense, a love for complex challenges, and the ability to clearly articulate how a product should work both in software and in the physical world.</p><p>Google&#39;s mission is to organize the world&#39;s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Our Hardware team researches, designs, and develops new technologies and hardware to make our user&#39;s interaction with computing faster, more powerful, and seamless. Whether finding new ways to capture and sense the world around us, advancing form factors, or improving interaction methods, our Hardware team is making people&#39;s lives better through technology.</p>",
