    "description": "<p>In this role, you will shape Google&#39;s own digital advertising campaigns and use your feedback to invent the future of Google\u2019s advertising products. You will have the unique opportunity to work on campaigns across a portfolio or products, be it a consumer product (like Search, hardware devices, Maps, or Chrome) or a business product (like AdWords or Google Cloud). You will lead innovation across new and established product campaigns across your region and act as a key connection point to other regions and our agency partners.</p><p>Know the user. Know the magic. Connect the two. At its core, marketing at Google starts with technology and ends with the user, bringing both together in unconventional ways. Our job is to demonstrate how Google&#39;s products solve the world&#39;s problems--from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can--changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.</p>",
