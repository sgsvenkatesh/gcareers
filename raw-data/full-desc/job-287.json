    "description": "<p>The Hardware and Retail Marketing organization is responsible for driving the growth of Google&#39;s hardware brands, including but not limited to Google Pixel, Google Home, Pixelbook, wearables and accessories. We partner with product teams to understand the user, shape the product roadmap, and bring products to market through coordinated global media campaigns. Google is committed to building radically effective experiences for customers at the intersection of hardware, software and artificial intelligence, and we\u2019re growing the team.</p>\n\n\n<p>Google is a place of thinkers, builders and relentless doers. We work on problems that everyone encounters in their homes, and we thrive on challenges. We deliver excellent products and experiences that surprise and delight our customers, and shape the home space.\n</p>\n\n\n<p>Our team is looking to drive disruption and innovation. As a Field Marketing Lead, you&#39;ll help us frame and communicate the benefits of the programs and services locally. In this role, you&#39;ll develop hypotheses and leverage a test-and-learn mindset to uncover what marketing and communication strategies resonate with our users.</p><p>Know the user. Know the magic. Connect the two. At its core, marketing at Google starts with technology and ends with the user, bringing both together in unconventional ways. Our job is to demonstrate how Google&#39;s products solve the world&#39;s problems--from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can--changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.</p>",
