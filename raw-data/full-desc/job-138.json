    "description": "<p>When leading companies choose Google Cloud it&#39;s a huge win for spreading the power of cloud computing globally. Once educational institutions, government agencies, and other businesses sign on to use Google Cloud products, you come in to facilitate making their work more productive, mobile, and collaborative. You assist fellow sales Googlers by problem-solving key technical issues for our customers. You liaise with the product marketing management and engineering teams to stay on top of industry trends and devise enhancements to Google Cloud products.</p>\n\n\n<p>As a Partner Engineering Manager, your goal will be to help build a robust and self-sufficient partner ecosystem capable of driving a significant portion of our business through an indirect channel. We believe that ultimate scale is achieved by investing in and developing our channel business. As educational institutions, government agencies, and other businesses increasingly adopt public and hybrid cloud computing, more than ever they need partners to help enterprises understand and quantify the business and technical benefits. These enterprises also depend on partners to understand the cost and risk of moving to cloud, helping them develop governance models to mitigate for the unexpected.\nPartner Engineering managers possess expert communication, collaboration, and business skills enabling them to develop trusted relationships with the key decision-makers at partners. These relationships will be leveraged to build and drive business plans that expand the reach of Google Cloud.</p><p>From startups building their first app to billion-user consumer companies crunching big data, the Google Cloud Platform gives developers and businesses the most advanced data and analytics solution on the market, along with Google&#39;s secure, high performance infrastructure. Our team of technical account managers and software engineers work with partners across all functions to develop solutions that harness Google&#39;s planet-wide platform to solve the world&#39;s most challenging problems.</p>",
