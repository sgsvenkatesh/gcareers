    "description": "<p>Whether you&#39;re on a consumer product (like Gmail, Search, Maps, Chrome, Android) or a business product (Google Ads, AdSense, Google Marketing Platform, Analytics), you take part in a complete marketing experience as you lead every facet of the product&#39;s journey. From determining positioning, naming, competitive analysis, feature prioritization and external communications, you help shape the voice of the product and help it grow a consumer base. This means you work with a cross-functional team across Sales, corporate communications, legal, webmasters, product development, engineering and more. In this role, you&#39;ll be involved with product marketing strategy from beginning to end.</p><p>In this role, you&#39;ll shape the product development process, organize product launches from beginning to end and inform future marketing strategies.</p><p>As a member of the Consumer Apps Marketing team, you&#39;ll develop partnerships, programs, and outreach strategies designed for growing apps with film and television partners. Using key features of our products, you\u2019ll develop programs and partnerships around key uses of our apps that scale globally. You&#39;ll align our strategy with the right content opportunities, cross-functional planning, negotiations and ongoing communications with partners.</p><p>Know the user. Know the magic. Connect the two. At its core, marketing at Google starts with technology and ends with the user, bringing both together in unconventional ways. Our job is to demonstrate how Google&#39;s products solve the world&#39;s problems--from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can--changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.</p>",
