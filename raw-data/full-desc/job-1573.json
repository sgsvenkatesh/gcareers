    "description": "<p>Whether you&#39;re on a consumer product (like Gmail, Search, Maps, Chrome, Android) or a business product (Google Ads, AdSense, Google Marketing Platform, Analytics), you take part in a complete marketing experience as you lead every facet of the product&#39;s journey. From determining positioning, naming, competitive analysis, feature prioritization and external communications, you help shape the voice of the product and help it grow a consumer base. This means you work with a cross-functional team across Sales, corporate communications, legal, webmasters, product development, engineering and more. In this role, you&#39;ll be involved with product marketing strategy from beginning to end.</p><p>AppDev is one of the fastest growing business segments within Google\u2019s Ads business and we\u2019re looking for an outstanding Product Marketing Manager to drive exponential growth. </p><p>As an AppDev Product Marketing Manager, you\u2019ll be responsible for generating insights from our AppDev ecosystem to inform our ongoing marketing strategy, and subsequently working cross-functionally to execute it. You should be an exceptional strategic thinker who is savvy about Google business products, and how customers see these products in relation to their business. More specifically, you will be designing and executing the growth marketing strategy for Universal App Campaigns, Google\u2019s ads product for the booming apps market. You will work with a cross-functional team across Sales, product, legal, webmasters, regional marketing, and media to bring together teams and resources and drive exponential growth in this exciting segment.</p><p>Know the user. Know the magic. Connect the two. At its core, marketing at Google starts with technology and ends with the user, bringing both together in unconventional ways. Our job is to demonstrate how Google&#39;s products solve the world&#39;s problems--from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can--changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.</p>",
