    "description": "<p>Google&#39;s projects, like our users, span the globe and require managers to keep the big picture in focus while being able to dive into the unique engineering challenges we face daily. As a Technical Program Manager at Google, you lead complex, multi-disciplinary engineering projects using your engineering expertise. You plan requirements with internal customers and usher projects through the entire project lifecycle. This includes managing project schedules, identifying risks and clearly communicating them to project stakeholders. You&#39;re equally at home explaining your team&#39;s analyses and recommendations to executives as you are discussing the technical trade-offs in product development with engineers.</p>\n\n<p>Our products help achieve optimal utilization of Google&#39;s infrastructure fleet. The overall goal of the Resource Management team is to reduce the cost of fleet resources per unit of load at Google level. Our team provides authoritative resource utilization and financial data on compute, storage, network and machine data, including the new Machine Learning fleet, for Product Areas to make resource tradeoffs and decrease future orders for resources. We also work on compute and storage efficiency improvements through the fleet to enable further resource cost savings.\n</p>\n\n<p>As a Technical Program Manager, you&#39;ll work to help plan and execute on various product development activities in the Resource Management (RM) team. The RM team develops infrastructure software products on which Google products run. These software products enable Product teams to request, provision, manage, forecast, and scale the compute, storage and network resources as well as track and measure the usage and costs of resources to guide the optimal utilization. The financial projections of resources are an important aspect of RM&#39;s product and directly contribute to the planning process of the Finance team.</p><p>Behind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technical Infrastructure team to keep it running. From developing and maintaining our data centers to building the next generation of Google platforms, we make Google&#39;s product portfolio possible. We&#39;re proud to be our engineers&#39; engineers and love voiding warranties by taking things apart so we can rebuild them. We&#39;re always on call to keep our networks up and running, ensuring our users have the best and fastest experience possible.</p>",
