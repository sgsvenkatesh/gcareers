    "description": "<p>Google accountants are a savvy bunch who handle the core accounting responsibilities at Google. As a member of this team, you know your accounting principles and the full accounting process end to end. You&#39;ll advise on financial reports required by governmental regulations, and you&#39;ll review, analyze, and interpret financial and budgetary reports -- and all this sounds like fun to you. Every day is a new challenge, and you&#39;re continually looking for ways to help our team get better at what we do, in the most efficient way possible. A team player at heart, you collaborate with our global team, advocate best practices and roll up your sleeves to pitch in when it&#39;s all hands on deck. You move fast while keeping your attention to detail, and you tap into your problem-solving skills to support Google&#39;s business objectives.</p>\n\n\n<p>In this role, you will have the opportunity to work on one of Google\u2019s fastest growing businesses. As part of the broader Hardware finance team, you will be looked upon to coordinate across all finance areas on finance operational matters related to Incentives. You will play a key role in influencing business decisions via your insights on incentives.</p><p>The name Google came from &quot;googol,&quot; a mathematical term for the number 1 followed by 100 zeros. And nobody at Google loves big numbers like the Finance team when providing in depth analysis on all manner of strategic decisions across Google products. From developing forward-thinking analysis to generating management reports to scaling our automated financial processes, the Finance organization is an important partner and advisor to the business.</p>",
