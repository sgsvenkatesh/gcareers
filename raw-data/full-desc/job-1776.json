    "description": "<p>Google&#39;s projects, like our users, span the globe and require managers to keep the big picture in focus while being able to dive into the unique engineering challenges we face daily. As a Technical Program Manager at Google, you lead complex, multi-disciplinary engineering projects using your engineering expertise. You plan requirements with internal customers and usher projects through the entire project lifecycle. This includes managing project schedules, identifying risks and clearly communicating them to project stakeholders. You&#39;re equally at home explaining your team&#39;s analyses and recommendations to executives as you are discussing the technical trade-offs in product development with engineers.</p>\n\n<p>Google Mobile Services (GMS) Core\u2019s module-based infrastructure provides regularly updated Google services and APIs to Android devices globally \u2013 including phones, tablets, TVs, Wearables, Cars, and IoT. \n</p>\n\n<p>As a Technical Program Manager, you will build infrastructure and programs that ship software updates to devices. Across a fragmented device fleet, we have a huge testing matrix, massive amounts of code churn from product areas all across Google that rely on GMS Core to ship features to the entire fleet.</p><p>Making the world&#39;s information universally accessible and useful doesn&#39;t stop at the desktop. The Mobile team builds tools to get you the information you need no matter where you are. Android has become the world&#39;s most popular mobile ecosystem, powering billions of devices, from smartphones to tablets, watches to TVs and everything in between. Whether adding to the core Android experience, forging new markets for digital content, creating immersive and portable versions of our products or managing relationships with a global community of developers, the Mobile team is giving you Google on the go.</p>",
