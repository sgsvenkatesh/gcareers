As a Financial Analyst, your work, whether it&#39;s modeling business scenarios or tracking performance metrics, is used by our leaders to make strategic company decisions. A master juggler working on multiple projects at a time, you are focused on the details while finding creative ways to take on big picture challenges.</p>\n\n<p>You are a quick-witted and intelligent financial analyst and are at ease in a constantly changing environment, where poise under pressure and attention to detail are critical to the team\u2019s success.\n</p>\n\n<p>As an Investor Relations Analyst, you will coordinate quarterly earnings calls and support the ongoing communications activities of the firm with shareholders and sell-side research analysts. You will work cross-functionally and provide a broad level of exposure throughout the organization, including with senior executives.</p><p>The name Google came from &quot;googol,&quot; a mathematical term for the number 1 followed by 100 zeros. And nobody at Google loves big numbers like the Finance team when providing in depth analysis on all manner of strategic decisions across Google products. From developing forward-thinking analysis to generating management reports to scaling our automated financial processes, the Finance organization is an important partner and advisor to the business.</p>",
