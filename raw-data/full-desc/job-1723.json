    "description": "<p>Google&#39;s software engineers develop the next-generation technologies that change how billions of users connect, explore, and interact with information and one another. Our products need to handle information at massive scale, and extend well beyond web search. We&#39;re looking for engineers who bring fresh ideas from all areas, including information retrieval, distributed computing, large-scale system design, networking and data storage, security, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, UI design and mobile; the list goes on and is growing every day. As a software engineer, you will work on a specific project critical to Google\u2019s needs with opportunities to switch teams and projects as you and our fast-paced business grow and evolve. We need our engineers to be versatile, display leadership qualities and be enthusiastic to take on new problems across the full-stack as we continue to push technology forward.</p>\n\n<p>The Chrome Networking team aims to push the Internet ecosystem to be faster, more secure and more resilient. Our network stack is used by desktop and mobile browsers, many of Google&#39;s first party apps on Android and iOS and is now publicly available for third party use on Android. \n</p>\n\n<p>As a Software Engineer, you will continue leading Quick UDP Internet Connections (QUIC) through the standardization process while keeping an eye out for new opportunities and spaces to innovate in the protocol space.</p><p>Google is and always will be an engineering company. We hire people with a broad set of technical skills who are ready to take on some of technology&#39;s greatest challenges and make an impact on millions, if not billions, of users.
