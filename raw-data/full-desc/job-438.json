    "description": "<p>Whether you&#39;re on a consumer product (like Gmail, Search, Maps, Chrome, Android) or a business product (Google Ads, AdSense, Google Marketing Platform, Analytics), you take part in a complete marketing experience as you lead every facet of the product&#39;s journey. From determining positioning, naming, competitive analysis, feature prioritization and external communications, you help shape the voice of the product and help it grow a consumer base. This means you work with a cross-functional team across Sales, corporate communications, legal, webmasters, product development, engineering and more. In this role, you&#39;ll be involved with product marketing strategy from beginning to end.</p><p>The Marketing Operations team is responsible for identifying, building, and streamlining process optimization within Google\u2019s Marketing Organization. As the Talent/Music Rights Operations Manager, you&#39;ll work closely with all Marketing Product Areas and associated agency partners to instill and create a process where talent rights are visible, secure, and easily accessible. Establishing new global processes you will also work closely with regional contacts and global/local Marketing teams.</p><p>Know the user. Know the magic. Connect the two. At its core, marketing at Google starts with technology and ends with the user, bringing both together in unconventional ways. Our job is to demonstrate how Google&#39;s products solve the world&#39;s problems--from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can--changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.</p>",
