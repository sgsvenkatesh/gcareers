    "description": "<p>As a member of the Executive Communications team, you will be part of a small team which produces employee communications and events for Google executives. You will work with members of your internal client team on communications initiatives, projects and programs. You will support the work of the team to create strategic communications campaigns, come up with innovative ways to engage employees that are in tune with Google&#39;s culture, write communications, business update presentations and talking points. You will also collaborate with internal partners as needed across functions (PR, Policy, Legal, HR, Operations, etc.) and geographies.</p>\n\n\n<p>You are excited by technical complexity and always eager to learn more, whether about generative adversarial networks or computational photography. You know how researchers think and where tension can arise in a research organization, from representing technical concepts accurately to sharing credit properly.\n</p>\n\n\n<p>This role is primarily internal-facing -- you\u2019ll engage with our research organization on technical details. You have experience wrangling a loosely structured, bottom-up organization with ambitions in every direction. Your work will be reflected externally, as you help our researchers translate their complex ideas into blog posts, decks, speaking opportunities, etc. You\u2019ll ensure we\u2019re always technically accurate while highlighting the research that\u2019s most exciting.</p><p>It&#39;s our job to help inform and educate users, advertisers, partners, opinion leaders--and our own employees--about the benefits of Google&#39;s products, our distinctive company culture/values and our approach to the big public policy issues of the day. We are looking for quick-witted, entrepreneurial and intellectually curious people to join the team. To succeed here, you&#39;ll need to be a creative self-starter who is willing to try new things and can manage numerous projects with tight deadlines. Things happen quickly at Google, and to do great work you need to be an enthusiastic team player who can work cross-functionally with partners across PR, comms, marketing, product and beyond.</p>",
