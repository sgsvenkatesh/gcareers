    "description": "<p>Google&#39;s projects, like our users, span the globe and require managers to keep the big picture in focus while being able to dive into the unique engineering challenges we face daily. As a Technical Program Manager at Google, you lead complex, multi-disciplinary engineering projects using your engineering expertise. You plan requirements with internal customers and usher projects through the entire project lifecycle. This includes managing project schedules, identifying risks and clearly communicating them to project stakeholders. You&#39;re equally at home explaining your team&#39;s analyses and recommendations to executives as you are discussing the technical trade-offs in product development with engineers.</p>\n\n<p>As a Technical Program Manager, you&#39;ll be a key member of the Engineering team working to deliver feature requirements for the product in a timely manner for internationalization productization, infrastructure software and backend service deliverables. You will work closely with Engineering, Product Management (PM), Site Reliability Engineering SREs, Platforms and Partner Engineering to define these requirements, and will work closely with Engineering to scope the resulting features and schedule the delivery and ensure your areas can release reliably, predictably and with high-quality at a predictable release cadence. You&#39;ll play a key role in ensuring the requirements are captured, managing cross-group communication and technical dependencies with other Google teams, creating and driving the overall schedule, identifying and mitigating risk at all stages, and defining the overall rhythm and meeting touchpoints between teams.</p><p>Google&#39;s mission is to organize the world&#39;s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Our Hardware team researches, designs, and develops new technologies and hardware to make our user&#39;s interaction with computing faster, more powerful, and seamless. Whether finding new ways to capture and sense the world around us, advancing form factors, or improving interaction methods, our Hardware team is making people&#39;s lives better through technology.</p>",
