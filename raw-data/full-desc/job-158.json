As a member of this team, you&#39;re always looking for innovative ways to help Google invest for the future while limiting volatility and material surprises.

From developing forward-thinking analysis to generating management reports to scaling our automated financial processes, the Finance organization is an important partner and advisor to the business.</p>",
