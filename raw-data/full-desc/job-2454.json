    "description": "<p>How do you release updates and changes to the world&#39;s most trafficked sites without users ever noticing a glitch in service? Our Release Engineering team takes on this very challenge. As a member of the team, you work with Software Engineers to ensure our services and products seamlessly move from development through rollout and into production. This requires scripting and coding with an eye toward scalability so that big deployments can be broken down and distributed across multiple data centers. You are excited by massively complex systems and the challenges that come from working with some of the largest computing systems in the world. From changing the look of Google Search to backend tweaks to our algorithms, we are constantly pushing updates and iterating on all of our products.</p>\n\n<p>Using your leadership and technical expertise, you manage small project teams and lead the complex application releases for production and develop major improvement to tools and processes.</p><p>At Google, our users come first, and the Systems Infrastructure team is at the heart of that promise. We build the technologies that transform the way we think about doing business. Whether working on our cloud systems, researching the latest in computer technology or keeping Google&#39;s internal systems humming, Googlers and users alike rely on us to keep things running. We&#39;re back-end experts: protecting your privacy and ensuring your security.</p>",
