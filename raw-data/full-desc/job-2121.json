As a member of this team, you&#39;re always looking for innovative ways to help Google invest for the future while limiting volatility and material surprises. In addition to risk busting and asset management, you work collaboratively to administer business insurance programs and stock programs, and provide financial analysis support to our internal teams. You make creative yet calculated decisions that are backed by both experience and your extensive knowledge of the economy and financial industry.</p>\n\n<p>As a Treasury Operations Analyst, you will help support our growing corporate Treasury Operations function. The role will include oversight of daily operational support across the Treasury landscape. Primary responsibilities will entail trade support for the Portfolio Management and FX team, third party vendor management, and support for systems implementation and integration.

You are also skilled at communicating complex problems to senior stakeholders.</p><p>The name Google came from &quot;googol,&quot; a mathematical term for the number 1 followed by 100 zeros. And nobody at Google loves big numbers like the Finance team when providing in depth analysis on all manner of strategic decisions across Google products. From developing forward-thinking analysis to generating management reports to scaling our automated financial processes, the Finance organization is an important partner and advisor to the business.</p>",
