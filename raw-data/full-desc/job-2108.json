As a Program Manager at Google, you lead complex, multi-disciplinary projects. You plan requirements with internal customers and usher projects through the entire project lifecycle. This includes managing project schedules, identifying risks and clearly communicating goals to project stakeholders. Your projects often span offices, time zones and hemispheres, and it&#39;s your job to keep all the players coordinated on the project&#39;s progress and deadlines.</p>\n\n\n<p>The Finance Works team identifies time-consuming internal processes and then builds solutions that are reliable and scalable enough to work within the size and scope of the company. You will listen to and translate Googler needs into high-level technical specifications, design and develop recommended systems and consult with Google executives to ensure smooth implementation. Whether battling large system processes or leveraging our homegrown suite of Google products for Googlers themselves, you help Googlers work faster and more efficiently.\n</p>\n\n\n<p>As a Program Manager in Finance Works, you will drive the planning, execution and tracking of a major Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) transformation effort that span across several products and services across order-to-cash, payroll and source-to-pay business processes. You will track, control and report progress for the ERP transformation project. This transformation will span across organizations, people, process and systems dimensions, and will have impacts across our global organization.</p><p>Behind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technical Infrastructure team to keep it running.
