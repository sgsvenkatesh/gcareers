    "description": "<p>Google&#39;s projects, like our users, span the globe and require managers to keep the big picture in focus. As a Program Manager at Google, you lead complex, multi-disciplinary projects. You plan requirements with internal customers and usher projects through the entire project lifecycle. This includes managing project schedules, identifying risks and clearly communicating goals to project stakeholders. Your projects often span offices, time zones and hemispheres, and it&#39;s your job to keep all the players coordinated on the project&#39;s progress and deadlines.</p>\n\n<p>As a Program Manager on the Growth and Notifications Team (GaNT), you\u2019ll be in charge of driving Growth efforts that have company-wide impact, including daily interfacing with Growth Product and Engineering teams, relationship management with Product, Marketing, and Engineering teams across the company, planning the occasional summit, and, of course, finding a way to track its scale. You will drive weekly meetings, have direct input to product and engineering roadmaps, and will be the single point-of-contact for all cross-functional teams.\n</p>\n\n<p>GaNT is fast-paced with high executive visibility and the opportunity to work across functions and product areas at Google. We address challenges like; what is the best way to leverage our existing products (on mobile and desktop) to grow our user base and how can we target priority segments? How can we create a \u201cGoogle app ecosystem\u201d where having multiple Google products benefits the user and how can we promote growth without creating a negative or intrusive user experience?</p><p>Google is and always will be an engineering company. We hire people with a broad set of technical skills who are ready to take on some of technology&#39;s greatest challenges and make an impact on millions, if not billions, of users. At Google, engineers not only revolutionize search, they routinely work on massive scalability and storage solutions, large-scale applications and entirely new platforms for developers around the world. From Google Ads to Chrome, Android to YouTube, Social to Local, Google engineers are changing the world one technological achievement after another.</p>",
