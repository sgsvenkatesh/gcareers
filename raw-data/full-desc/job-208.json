    "description": "<p>Whether you&#39;re on a consumer product (like Gmail, Search, Maps, Chrome, Android) or a business product (Google Ads, AdSense, Google Marketing Platform, Analytics), you take part in a complete marketing experience as you lead every facet of the product&#39;s journey. From determining positioning, naming, competitive analysis, feature prioritization and external communications, you help shape the voice of the product and help it grow a consumer base. This means you work with a cross-functional team across Sales, corporate communications, legal, webmasters, product development, engineering and more. In this role, you&#39;ll be involved with product marketing strategy from beginning to end.</p>\n\n\n<p>The Hardware (HW) Marketing Social team is focused on establishing Google as the most desired and loved hardware brand. We\u2019re looking for a Social Marketing Lead to build brand love through our social strategy and lead the charge to take social beyond just the feed and integrate social across multiple customer touch-points. \n</p>\n\n\n<p>In this role, you will be responsible for both strategy and operations. As a strategist, you\u2019ll be expected to lead and define our global cross hardware social strategy for Made by Google to support our HW brand and HW products (i.e., Pixel, Create). You\u2019ll be responsible for executing this vision and measuring the impact by working closely with cross-functional partners, including our Social Creative Agency Partner, Product and Consumer Marketing teams, and Social Support and Operations teams.</p><p>Know the user. Know the magic. Connect the two. At its core, marketing at Google starts with technology and ends with the user, bringing both together in unconventional ways. Our job is to demonstrate how Google&#39;s products solve the world&#39;s problems--from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can--changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.</p>",
