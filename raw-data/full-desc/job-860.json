    "description": "<p>Finance Project Managers drive critical priorities for Google by leading and assisting in projects of all sizes. Drawing from your strong financial background, you work with a diverse team to manage projects from concept to implementation and keep Google-wide stakeholders informed as you go. You get down into the details of complex analyses without losing sight of the overall objective. When working on multiple projects at once, you intuitively know which issues to highlight and can bring key decision makers together to come up with effective solutions. Once a project is completed, you&#39;re able to clearly communicate the results and draw the key learnings for senior management. You are efficient and organized, making the most of everyone&#39;s abilities and holding the team to a high standard.</p>\n\n<p>As a Business Functional Project Lead, you will manage your assignments through the entire project lifecycle working closely with Finance, Corporate Engineering teams, and Professional Services partners to deliver on goals. You&#39;ll work with Finance teams on complex projects to establish overarching strategy, goals, and objectives, define requirements, design new business processes and data, structure and implement projects, and communicate status to stakeholders. \n</p>\n\n<p>In this role, you will work closely with multiple groups leveraging your knowledge of Finance processes and systems to build relationships and develop solutions that meet our future business requirements. Additionally, you&#39;ll leverage an understanding of Finance processes in the areas of Financial Planning and Analysis (FP&amp;A), Management, and Internal Reporting, to evaluate alternatives, guide decision making, solve challenges, provide analytical insight, and business judgment to support strategic and tactical initiatives across the organization.</p><p>The name Google came from &quot;googol,&quot; a mathematical term for the number 1 followed by 100 zeros. And nobody at Google loves big numbers like the Finance team when providing in depth analysis on all manner of strategic decisions across Google products. From developing forward-thinking analysis to generating management reports to scaling our automated financial processes, the Finance organization is an important partner and advisor to the business.</p>",
