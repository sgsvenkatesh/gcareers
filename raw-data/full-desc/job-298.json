    "description": "<p>Google&#39;s projects, like our users, span the globe and require managers to keep the big picture in focus. As a Program Manager at Google, you lead complex, multi-disciplinary projects. You plan requirements with internal customers and usher projects through the entire project lifecycle. This includes managing project schedules, identifying risks and clearly communicating goals to project stakeholders. Your projects often span offices, time zones and hemispheres, and it&#39;s your job to keep all the players coordinated on the project&#39;s progress and deadlines.</p>\n\n<p>Our mission is to assist users as they navigate and explore the world \u2014 wherever they are. Making that mission a reality includes an efficient and effective operations team that is deployed in everything from bootstrapping data collection to moderating incoming user edits to imagery hardware development, to ad hoc data evaluation to training machine learning models.\n</p>\n\n<p>This team supports all of GDO\u2019s data verticals by managing tools, policy, training, and incident management through close collaboration with Engineering, Product, and vendor counterparts. Our policy and training efforts are critical in maintaining high quality geo data worldwide. They provide the foundations and guidelines for operators, and are developed by a team of program managers who partner closely with various teams to develop sound, scalable policies that are used across Geo. Our team also maintains the oversight of the training modules necessary to keep our operations well equipped to support every Geo initiative.</p><p>The Geo team builds the most accurate, comprehensive, and useful maps for our users. More than a billion people rely on Google Maps services to explore the world and navigate their daily lives. That includes sailing down the Amazon river, choosing where to get a bite of pizza, flying over a 3D version of New York City and saving time commuting. <br><br>Geo helps merchants get their businesses on Google, and more than a million developers use the power of Google Maps to enhance their apps and websites. They are solving complex computer science problems, designing beautiful and intuitive product experiences and improving the accuracy of our geo data, all in order to plot a course for the future of mapping.</p>",
