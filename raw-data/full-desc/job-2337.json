The Data Management team addresses a diverse set of technical challenges, including managing large volumes of corporate data, enabling data discovery and security, mastering and integrating disparate datasets, and delivering to our business partners a clean, secure data marketplace for reporting and advanced analytics. \n</p>\n\n<p>In this role you will work closely with Engineering, Business and Product partner teams and leadership across functions to define strategies, align project priorities and coordinate execution. You will enable extended team effectiveness and productivity by providing insight, plans and process to execute highly cross-functional projects at scale.</p><p>Behind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technical Infrastructure team to keep it running. From developing and maintaining our data centers to building the next generation of Google platforms, we make Google&#39;s product portfolio possible.
