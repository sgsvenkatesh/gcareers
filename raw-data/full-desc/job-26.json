    "description": "<p>The Geo Enterprise Business Strategy and Operations team is responsible for all elements of the business, from early stage market assessment to programmatically scaling the business and supporting our customer base. The team determines our commercialization strategy and plans, how best we take our products and platforms to market and operationalizing the rollout to our customers and partners. The team is also responsible for accelerating business growth and driving customer engagement and retention through agile, data-driven learning and programs and an exceptional support experience. \n</p>\n\n\n<p>To succeed in this role, you will need to influence seamlessly within the Geo Enterprise team and across Google. The role requires collaborating and working closely with Product, Engineering, and Sales and will require you to modulate your communication and working styles commensurately. You will also need to be comfortable flexing your work style, from working with a high level of ambiguity when determining early product go-to-market plans, to laser-focused execution on delivering business goals.</p><p>The Geo team builds the most accurate, comprehensive, and useful maps for our users. More than a billion people rely on Google Maps services to explore the world and navigate their daily lives. That includes sailing down the Amazon river, choosing where to get a bite of pizza, flying over a 3D version of New York City and saving time commuting. <br><br>Geo helps merchants get their businesses on Google, and more than a million developers use the power of Google Maps to enhance their apps and websites. They are solving complex computer science problems, designing beautiful and intuitive product experiences and improving the accuracy of our geo data, all in order to plot a course for the future of mapping.</p>",
