    "description": "<p>Our computational challenges are so big, complex and unique we can&#39;t just purchase off-the-shelf hardware, we&#39;ve got to make it ourselves. Your team designs and builds the hardware, software and networking technologies that power all of Google&#39;s services. As a Hardware Engineer, you design and build the systems that are the heart of the world&#39;s largest and most powerful computing infrastructure. You develop from the lowest levels of circuit design to large system design and see those systems all the way through to high volume manufacturing. Your work has the potential to shape the machinery that goes into our cutting-edge data centers affecting millions of Google users. <br><br>With your technical expertise, you lead projects in multiple areas of expertise (i.e., engineering domains or systems) within a data center facility, including construction and equipment installation/troubleshooting/debugging with vendors.</p>\n\n<p>In this role, you will be part of Google\u2019s Consumer Hardware Silicon team, developing high performance and low power hardware to enable Google\u2019s continuous innovations in mobile. \n</p>\n\n<p>You will develop design-for-test (DFT) specifications, and use design-for-test methodologies and automation scripts as well as write documentation. Similarly, you will perform technical evaluations of vendors, process nodes, IP, and will provide recommendations.\n</p>\n\n<p>As part of your role, you will work with logic designers, verification engineers, physical designers, and product engineers to develop design-for-test specifications and plans with time and test cost goals. You will also explore RTL/design tradeoffs for optimizing DFT metrics.</p><p>Google&#39;s mission is to organize the world&#39;s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Our Hardware team researches, designs, and develops new technologies and hardware to make our user&#39;s interaction with computing faster, more powerful, and seamless. Whether finding new ways to capture and sense the world around us, advancing form factors, or improving interaction methods, our Hardware team is making people&#39;s lives better through technology.</p>",
