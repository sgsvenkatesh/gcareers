    "description": "<p>Whether you&#39;re on a consumer product (like Gmail, Search, Maps, Chrome, Android) or a business product (Google Ads, AdSense, Google Marketing Platform, Analytics), you take part in a complete marketing experience as you lead every facet of the product&#39;s journey. From determining positioning, naming, competitive analysis, feature prioritization and external communications, you help shape the voice of the product and help it grow a loyal consumer base. This means you work with a cross-functional team across sales, corporate communications, legal, webmasters, product development, engineering and more. In this role, you&#39;ll be involved with product marketing strategy from beginning to end.</p>\n\n<p>The Growth Lab team is a team with high executive visibility and the opportunity to work across functions and product areas at Google. Our goal is to provide insights, best practices, tools, and services to help Product and Marketing teams engage more users.\n</p>\n\n<p>As a Behavioral Sciences Marketing Manager, you will be a key part of building out Google\u2019s new Behavioral Science Team, an increasingly important driver of growth for the company across all products, from Google Search and Google Ads to Chrome, Android, YouTube and emerging businesses. As a behavioral scientist within Marketing, you will be a fully dedicated business leader and strategic thinker, shaping the future of one of our many Google consumer and business products. Using your background in behavioral science and experimental research methods, you will inform decisions about how we design our marketing efforts and how we develop product features and the overall user experience.\n</p>\n\n<p>In this role, you will be helping to build out the behavioral science function within Growth Lab. You will join a team of experienced growth experts and collaborate closely with the central Growth Product, Engineering, Growth Marketing, and Product Growth teams to design marketing and product changes informed by behavioral science. This is a highly collaborative role and you\u2019ll develop ongoing relationships with teams to help build sustainable, long-term growth. You will participate in release cycles, weekly experiments, and cross-functional collaboration that will have measurable impact.</p><p>Know the user. Know the magic. Connect the two. At its core, marketing at Google starts with technology and ends with the user, bringing both together in unconventional ways. Our job is to demonstrate how Google&#39;s products solve the world&#39;s problems--from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can--changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.</p>",
