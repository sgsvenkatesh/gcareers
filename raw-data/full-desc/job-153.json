    "description": "<p>Google&#39;s custom-designed machines make up one of the largest and most powerful computing infrastructures in the world. The Hardware Testing Engineering team ensures that this cutting-edge equipment is reliable. In the R&amp;D lab, you design test equipment for prototypes of our machinery and develop the protocols used to scale these tests for the entire global team. Working closely with design engineers, you give input on designs to improve our hardware until you&#39;re sure it meets Google&#39;s standards of quality and reliability.<br><br>With your technical expertise, you create test plans for highly complex platforms (e.g., validating the interaction of multiple pieces of equipment at the networking and subsystem levels), and using your deep knowledge of component design characteristics, you diagnose highly complex hardware or software issues.</p>\n\n\n<p>In this role, you will provide support to Home/Nest Engineering teams, assisting new prototype board bring-up and development testing which includes test set-up and troubleshooting prototypes boards down to component level. You will execute test plans such as signal integrity measurements, power measurements, updating devices/boards with latest Firmware/software. Additionally, you will help assemble and disassemble prototype devices, test fixtures, maintain a well documented SOP, and work across technical teams to provide lab support, assisting with board level modification such as fine pitch soldering (0201) and BGA rework. You will also manage and maintain lab stock supplies and equipment.</p><p>Google&#39;s mission is to organize the world&#39;s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Our Hardware team researches, designs, and develops new technologies and hardware to make our user&#39;s interaction with computing faster, more powerful, and seamless. Whether finding new ways to capture and sense the world around us, advancing form factors, or improving interaction methods, our Hardware team is making people&#39;s lives better through technology.</p>",
