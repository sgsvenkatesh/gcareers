    "description": "<p>Google engineers develop the next-generation technologies that change how users connect, explore, and interact with information and one another. As a member of an extraordinarily creative, motivated and talented team, you develop new products that are used by millions of people. We need our engineers to be versatile and passionate to take on new problems as we continue to push technology forward. If you get excited about building new things and working across discipline lines, then our team might be your next career step.</p><p>As a Lead Hardware Engineer, you will guide system design, development and deployment of next-generation consumer hardware products. You are comfortable with specifying electrical architecture and with creating schematics. But just as importantly, you have a broad, cross-functional understanding of the disciplines involved in shipping a hardware product.</p><p>You will work with Google&#39;s product management team to assess viability and tradeoffs for new product features. You will be paired with a program manager, who will outline a program timeline and resource plan. Once the product is defined, you will guide the cross-functional engineering team (i.e., Electrical Engineering, Product Development, Instructional Designer, and etc.) through architecture, component selection, prototyping, validation and mass production release. You will be responsible for resolving technical conflicts between teams, managing cost and ensuring good Design for Excellence (DFX).</p><p>As the technical voice for the program, you will be the interpreter who helps teams understand each others&#39; constraints, and you will also represent the team when engineering topics are discussed with senior management.</p><p>Google&#39;s mission is to organize the world&#39;s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Our Hardware team researches, designs, and develops new technologies and hardware to make our user&#39;s interaction with computing faster, more powerful, and seamless. Whether finding new ways to capture and sense the world around us, advancing form factors, or improving interaction methods, our Hardware team is making people&#39;s lives better through technology.</p>",
