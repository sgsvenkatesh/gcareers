    "description": "<p>Google&#39;s software engineers develop the next-generation technologies that change how billions of users connect, explore, and interact with information and one another. Our products need to handle information at massive scale, and extend well beyond web search. We&#39;re looking for engineers who bring fresh ideas from all areas, including information retrieval, distributed computing, large-scale system design, networking and data storage, security, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, UI design and mobile; the list goes on and is growing every day. As a software engineer, you will work on a specific project critical to Google\u2019s needs with opportunities to switch teams and projects as you and our fast-paced business grow and evolve. We need our engineers to be versatile, display leadership qualities and be enthusiastic to take on new problems across the full-stack as we continue to push technology forward.<br><br>With your technical expertise you manage individual projects priorities, deadlines and deliverables. You design, develop, test, deploy, maintain, and enhance software solutions.</p>\n\n<p>You will be a member of the silicon team for a microcontroller project critical to Google products and infrastructure. You will participate in writing code for features within the microcontroller, full circle (embedded OS APIs, embedded OS applications, Android kernel drivers, and Android applications). You will work with the silicon and product teams to help define the embedded operating system requirements necessary to expose product features. You will work with manufacturing and product teams to help implement manufacturing and product test features, and you will work with silicon validation engineers to help develop functional silicon prior to manufacturing.</p><p>Google&#39;s mission is to organize the world&#39;s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Only one thing consistently stands in the way between our users and the world&#39;s information - hardware. Our Hardware team researches, designs, and develops new technologies and hardware to make our user&#39;s interaction with computing faster, more powerful, and seamless. Whether finding new ways to capture and sense the world around us, advancing form factors, or improving interaction methods, our Hardware team is making people&#39;s lives better through technology.</p>",
