    "description": "<p>At Google, our philosophy is build it, break it and then rebuild it better. That thinking is at the core of how we approach testing at Google. Unlike roles with similar names at the other companies, Test Engineers at Google aren&#39;t manual testers -- you write scripts to automate testing and create tools so developers can test their own code. As a Test Engineer, you navigate Google&#39;s massive codebase, identify weak spots and constantly design better and creative ways to break software and identify potential problems. You&#39;ll have a huge impact on the quality of Google&#39;s growing suite of products and services.</p>\n\n<p>As a Camera Test Engineer on the Centralized Test Engineering team, you will manage the testing of the functional performance of camera devices. You are a key member of the cross-functional team that will launch the product. \n</p>\n\n<p>You use your knowledge of testing and testability to influence better software design, promote proper engineering practice, bug prevention strategies, testability, accessibility and other advanced quality concepts across products.</p><p>Google&#39;s mission is to organize the world&#39;s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Our Hardware team researches, designs, and develops new technologies and hardware to make our user&#39;s interaction with computing faster, more powerful, and seamless. Whether finding new ways to capture and sense the world around us, advancing form factors, or improving interaction methods, our Hardware team is making people&#39;s lives better through technology.</p>",
