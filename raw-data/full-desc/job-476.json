    "description": "<p>Google&#39;s software engineers develop the next-generation technologies that change how billions of users connect, explore, and interact with information and one another. Our products need to handle information at massive scale, and extend well beyond web search. We&#39;re looking for engineers who bring fresh ideas from all areas, including information retrieval, distributed computing, large-scale system design, networking and data storage, security, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, UI design and mobile; the list goes on and is growing every day. As a software engineer, you will work on a specific project critical to Google\u2019s needs with opportunities to switch teams and projects as you and our fast-paced business grow and evolve. We need our engineers to be versatile, display leadership qualities and be enthusiastic to take on new problems across the full-stack as we continue to push technology forward.</p>\n\n<p>G Suite includes applications such as Gmail, Google Docs and Hangouts and is growing at a tremendous pace: Gmail has more than one billion active users, and other G Suite applications have hundreds of millions of active users. Google is now making a large bet on G Suite as the next generation Productivity Suite for businesses, schools and individuals. \n</p>\n\n<p>A key part of G Suite is our new video conferencing product, Hangouts Meet. The goal of Hangouts Meet is to transform team collaboration through video conferencing that is simple, reliable and ubiquitous. We believe that enabling effective collaboration across greater distances and in larger groups will help how people work, and we are looking to drive that change. To make this happen, the Hangouts Meet team is taking an end-to-end approach to making the product work seamlessly across phones, laptops and meeting rooms. This includes building hardware for meeting rooms, client platform and applications, as well as large scale service infrastructure and tools for admins.\n</p>\n\n<p>To continue scaling product and team development, we are looking to hire an Engineering Team Lead for Hangouts Meet in Kirkland. You will be responsible for Hangouts Meeting Room technology development and strategy in close collaboration with the broader global G Suite team. This will include driving next generation technology developments for real-time audio / video through combining traditional signal processing with new approaches including machine learning. \n</p>\n\n<p>As the Engineering Team Lead, you will lead the engineering efforts in the US and Stockholm who develop the hardware, platform, and software for meeting rooms. You will work closely with Engineering leadership throughout our locations.</p><p>The web is what you make of it and our team is helping the world make more of the web. From open-source pros to user-experience extraordinaires, we develop products that help users connect, communicate and collaborate with others. Our consumer products and cloud platforms are giving millions of users at homes, businesses, universities and nonprofits around the world the tools that shape their web experience -- and changing the way they think about computing.</p>",
