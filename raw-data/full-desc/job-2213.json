    "description": "<p>Google accountants are a savvy bunch who handle the core accounting responsibilities at Google. As a member of this team, you know your accounting principles and the full accounting process end to end. You&#39;ll advise on financial reports required by governmental regulations, and you&#39;ll review, analyze, and interpret financial and budgetary reports -- and all this sounds like fun to you. Every day is a new challenge, and you&#39;re continually looking for ways to help our team get better at what we do, in the most efficient way possible. A team player at heart, you collaborate with our global team, advocate best practices and roll up your sleeves to pitch in when it&#39;s all hands on deck. You move fast while keeping your attention to detail, and you tap into your problem-solving skills to support Google&#39;s business objectives.</p>\n\n<p>Google&#39;s projects, like our users, span the globe and require managers to keep the big picture in focus while being able to dive into the unique engineering challenges we face daily. \n</p>\n\n<p>As a Program Manager at Google, you provide operational and financial risk management support across several of Google Hardware\u2019s key business and product initiatives, and lead complex, multidisciplinary systems design, implementation, and integration projects using your technical expertise. You plan requirements with internal customers and usher projects through the entire project lifecycle. This includes coordinating cross-functional teams across Finance, Operations, Product, Engineering and Sales, managing project schedules, identifying risks and clearly communicating them to project stakeholders. \n</p>\n\n<p>You&#39;re equally at home explaining your team&#39;s analyses and recommendations to finance executives as you are discussing the technical trade-offs in systems development with engineers. Your collaboration, process design, communication, data analysis and project management skills are instrumental to this role.\n</p>\n\n<p>You will work with collaborative global teams while performing a broad array of financial risk management activities. Process transformation ensures that we think and act upon our processes and systems holistically and strategically as we strive to enable the business for success while maintaining an effective control environment and optimized resource allocation</p><p>The name Google came from &quot;googol,&quot; a mathematical term for the number 1 followed by 100 zeros. And nobody at Google loves big numbers like the Finance team when providing in depth analysis on all manner of strategic decisions across Google products. From developing forward-thinking analysis to generating management reports to scaling our automated financial processes, the Finance organization is an important partner and advisor to the business.</p>",
