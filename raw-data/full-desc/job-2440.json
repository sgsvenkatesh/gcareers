    "description": "<p>Google&#39;s projects, like our users, span the globe and require managers to keep the big picture in focus while being able to dive into the unique engineering challenges we face daily. As a Technical Program Manager at Google, you lead complex, multi-disciplinary engineering projects using your engineering expertise. You plan requirements with internal customers and usher projects through the entire project lifecycle. This includes managing project schedules, identifying risks and clearly communicating them to project stakeholders. You&#39;re equally at home explaining your team&#39;s analyses and recommendations to executives as you are discussing the technical trade-offs in product development with engineers.</p>\n\n<p>Google\u2019s network interconnects our data center infrastructure and serves network traffic from these data centers to our customers and end users. Optimal Network collaborates with engineering, product and planning teams across Google to optimize the network footprint and performance.\n</p>\n\n<p>Your role as a TPM (Technical Program Manager) in Optimal Network is critical to Google\u2019s success. You will own and drive cross-functional programs across multiple teams delivering Google\u2019s user-facing services. These programs span network usage optimization, cost optimization, performance optimization, demand forecasting, service delivery and other areas. You will be comfortable gathering data on service needs, then collaborating with cross-functional teams to design solutions, policies, processes and metrics to satisfy these needs. You will be comfortable presenting progress towards goals to executives and other stakeholders.\n</p>\n\n<p>Success in this role will require sound judgment under pressure, a strong technical background, meticulous attention to detail and outstanding communication skills. You will coordinate between many stakeholders, set expectations for deliverables from many different teams, keep track of success of parallel efforts, identify key roadblocks and work with the team members involved to keep things moving. You will be the owner of a large security program and ultimately responsible for its success.</p><p>Behind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technical Infrastructure team to keep it running. From developing and maintaining our data centers to building the next generation of Google platforms, we make Google&#39;s product portfolio possible. We&#39;re proud to be our engineers&#39; engineers and love voiding warranties by taking things apart so we can rebuild them. We&#39;re always on call to keep our networks up and running, ensuring our users have the best and fastest experience possible.</p>",
