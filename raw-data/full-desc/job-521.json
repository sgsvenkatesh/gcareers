    "description": "<p>Financial Analysts ensure that Google makes sound financial decisions. As a Financial Analyst, your work, whether it&#39;s modeling business scenarios or tracking performance metrics, is used by our leaders to make strategic company decisions. Working on multiple projects at a time, you&#39;ll stay focused on the details while finding creative ways to take on big picture challenges.</p>\n\n<p>As a Financial Analyst, you&#39;ll work with several of Google\u2019s advertiser-facing products. You&#39;ll have the opportunity to partner with the Sales Strategy (GSL) and Product Management (PM) teams while becoming an expert on our ads products at a global level. You will work side by side with the GSL and PM teams and enable decision making through appropriate analysis and support. You&#39;ll also act as a key advisor to Sales, PM and Finance leadership on issues related to market strategies, business profitability, and resource allocation. Further, you&#39;ll coordinate and execute on the results of these efforts with regional Sales and Finance teams. You&#39;ll have the opportunity to bring innovation and creativity to solve new strategic challenges such as how we think about product adoption and long-term financial health of the business.</p><p>The name Google came from &quot;googol,&quot; a mathematical term for the number 1 followed by 100 zeros. And nobody at Google loves big numbers like the Finance team when providing in depth analysis on all manner of strategic decisions across Google products. From developing forward-thinking analysis to generating management reports to scaling our automated financial processes, the Finance organization is an important partner and advisor to the business.</p>",
