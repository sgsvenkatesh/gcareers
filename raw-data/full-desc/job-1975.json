    "description": "<p>Google&#39;s projects, like our users, span the globe and require managers to keep the big picture in focus while being able to dive into the unique engineering challenges we face daily. As a Technical Program Manager at Google, you lead complex, multi-disciplinary engineering projects using your engineering expertise. You plan requirements with internal customers and usher projects through the entire project lifecycle. This includes managing project schedules, identifying risks and clearly communicating them to project stakeholders. You&#39;re equally at home explaining your team&#39;s analyses and recommendations to executives as you are discussing the technical trade-offs in product development with engineers.</p>\n\n\n<p>Our mission is to build amazing fitness and health experiences, and bring the best of Google services to users&#39; wrists. As a Technical Program Manager, you&#39;ll partner with leadership and shape the future of Wear and Fit. You will create and shape the processes of the entire organization - from how we develop and deliver software to how we communicate and coordinate across continents. You&#39;ll shape and drive multi-quarter roadmaps, work with partner engineering to deliver quality platforms, identify projects and their key path dependencies, mitigate risks, bring order out of chaos and ensure that our organization is strategically aligned with the needs of our customers.</p><p>One of the many reasons Google consistently brings innovative, world-changing products to market is because of the collaborative work we do in Product Management. With eyes focused squarely on the future, our team works closely with creative and prolific engineers to help design and develop technologies that improve access to the world&#39;s information. We&#39;re responsible for guiding products throughout the execution cycle, focusing specifically on analyzing, positioning, packaging, promoting and tailoring our solutions to all the markets where Google does business.</p>",
