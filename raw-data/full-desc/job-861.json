    "description": "<p>Google&#39;s software engineers develop the next-generation technologies that change how billions of users connect, explore, and interact with information and one another. Our products need to handle information at massive scale, and extend well beyond web search. We&#39;re looking for engineers who bring fresh ideas from all areas, including information retrieval, distributed computing, large-scale system design, networking and data storage, security, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, UI design and mobile; the list goes on and is growing every day. As a software engineer, you will work on a specific project critical to Google\u2019s needs with opportunities to switch teams and projects as you and our fast-paced business grow and evolve. We need our engineers to be versatile, display leadership qualities and be enthusiastic to take on new problems across the full-stack as we continue to push technology forward.</p>\n\n<p>The Go team is seeking a new engineer to help develop and maintain the Go compiler toolchain. The compiler toolchain includes the main Go compiler, assemblers, and linker, all of which are written in Go.\n</p>\n\n<p>You will work closely with senior team members to make improvements that impact every Go user and workload. Go is growing rapidly outside Google, especially as a language for cloud; improvements to Go\u2019s performance and debuggability increase its appeal for important workloads inside and outside of Google. The runtime and compiler serve all of its users and every program written in Go, so it\u2019s important that they keep up with and anticipate a huge spectrum of users&#39; needs.\n</p>\n\n<p>Google aspires to be an organization that reflects the globally diverse audience that our products and technology serve. We believe that in addition to hiring the best talent, a diversity of perspectives, ideas and cultures leads to the creation of better products and services.</p><p>Google is and always will be an engineering company. We hire people with a broad set of technical skills who are ready to take on some of technology&#39;s greatest challenges and make an impact on millions, if not billions, of users. At Google, engineers not only revolutionize search, they routinely work on massive scalability and storage solutions, large-scale applications and entirely new platforms for developers around the world. From Google Ads to Chrome, Android to YouTube, Social to Local, Google engineers are changing the world one technological achievement after another.</p>",
