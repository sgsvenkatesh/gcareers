    "description": "<p>As the Lead of the Vendor Management Office, you will help build the strategy on how REWS (Real Estate Workplace Services) sources and evaluates vendors, considering the medium and long-term needs for the organization. You also provide direction, vision and team leadership on how REWS engages, manages and drives transformation and innovation across its vendor base.\n</p>\n\n<p>You will effectively influence at all levels, and will interact with both Googler and vendor leadership teams. You will gather relevant data by building frameworks to extract, transform and analyze information that will ultimately drive strategic recommendations to partner managers across REWS. Googlers depend on your ability to help find the right vendor partners, identify clear vendor acceptance criteria, drive supplier management governance, analyze vendor portfolio risk and track performance and output management, all while maintaining perspective on the long-term health of REWS\u2019 vendor relationships. You will develop relationships, influence and collaborate with cross functional REWS teams, as well as Strategic Sourcing, XWS, Legal, and other partners across Google.</p><p>The Real Estate and Workplace Services (REWS) team creates inspiring spaces and innovative services that bring Google\u2019s culture and values to life.
