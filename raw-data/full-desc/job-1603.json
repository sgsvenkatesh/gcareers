    "description": "<p>Google&#39;s projects, like our users, span the globe and require managers to keep the big picture in focus while being able to dive into the unique engineering challenges we face daily. As a Technical Program Manager at Google, you lead complex, multi-disciplinary engineering projects using your engineering expertise. You plan requirements with internal customers and usher projects through the entire project lifecycle. This includes managing project schedules, identifying risks and clearly communicating them to project stakeholders. You&#39;re equally at home explaining your team&#39;s analyses and recommendations to executives as you are discussing the technical trade-offs in product development with engineers.<br><br>Using your extensive technical and leadership expertise, you manage projects of various size and scope, identifying future opportunities, improving processes and driving the technical directions of your programs.</p>\n\n<p>As a key member of the engineering team, you will work closely with a diverse set of Software Engineers, spanning all parts of the Chrome team. You will coordinate lots of fast-changing, moving parts and get them to come together as a product. You have communication and coordination skills to make sure that details aren\u2019t missed, blocking issues are resolved, and things stay on track. You will help set (collaborate on) the priorities for the team and keep everyone focused on delivering the most important and strategic initiatives. Overall, you will be driving a large, complex, and highly visible program.</p><p>Google is and always will be an engineering company. We hire people with a broad set of technical skills who are ready to take on some of technology&#39;s greatest challenges and make an impact on millions, if not billions, of users. At Google, engineers not only revolutionize search, they routinely work on massive scalability and storage solutions, large-scale applications and entirely new platforms for developers around the world. From Google Ads to Chrome, Android to YouTube, Social to Local, Google engineers are changing the world one technological achievement after another.</p>",
