    "description": "<p>&lt;p&gt;Whether you&#39;re on a consumer product (like Gmail, Search, Maps, Chrome, Android) or a business product (Google Ads, AdSense, Google Marketing Platform, Analytics), you take part in a complete marketing experience as you lead every facet of the product&#39;s journey. From determining positioning, naming, competitive analysis, feature prioritization and external communications, you help shape the voice of the product and help it grow a loyal consumer base. This means you work with a cross-functional team across sales, corporate communications, legal, webmasters, product development, engineering and more. In this role, you&#39;ll be involved with product marketing strategy from beginning to end.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;The Small Medium Business (SMB) Marketing team is dedicated to delivering an experience to our advertising customer, offering programs that create value for their businesses. As a Product Marketing Manager, you\u2019ll work closely with cross-functional teams (Product Marketing and Sales), and outside vendors, to develop integrated programs and strategic value adds (SVAs) for our advertising partners and end-customers. As a strong Project Manager, you\u2019re comfortable juggling multiple priorities and managing input and expectations across key stakeholders. You are a self-starter who can work in a rapidly-changing industry, tolerate ambiguity, and drive collaboration through influence.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p><br></p><p>Know the user. Know the magic. Connect the two. At its core, marketing at Google starts with technology and ends with the user, bringing both together in unconventional ways. Our job is to demonstrate how Google&#39;s products solve the world&#39;s problems--from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can--changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.</p>",
