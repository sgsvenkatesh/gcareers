Whether you are making our staffing systems more efficient, planning for our growth, building relationships on college campuses or cultivating the next generation of computer scientists, you have an eye on the staffing needs of Google and the broader hiring landscape. You are focused on cultivating outstanding candidates for Google&#39;s long-term hiring needs, and work across a cross-functional and international group of staffing teams. You are both scrappy and resourceful, creative and driven -- and excited to share the magic of working at Google.</p><p>Great just isn&#39;t good enough for our People Operations team (you probably know us better as &quot;Human Resources&quot;). Made up of equal parts HR professionals, former consultants and analysts, we&#39;re the advocates of Google&#39;s colorful culture. In People Ops, we &quot;find them, grow them, and keep them&quot; - we bring the world&#39;s most innovative people to Google and provide the programs that help them thrive.
