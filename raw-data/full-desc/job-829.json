    "description": "<p>Google accountants are a savvy bunch who handle the core accounting responsibilities at Google. As a member of this team, you know your accounting principles and the full accounting process end to end. You&#39;ll advise on financial reports required by governmental regulations, and you&#39;ll review, analyze, and interpret financial and budgetary reports -- and all this sounds like fun to you. Every day is a new challenge, and you&#39;re continually looking for ways to help our team get better at what we do, in the most efficient way possible. A team player at heart, you collaborate with our global team, advocate best practices and roll up your sleeves to pitch in when it&#39;s all hands on deck. You move fast while keeping your attention to detail, and you tap into your problem-solving skills to support Google&#39;s business objectives.</p>\n\n\n<p>As the Revenue Accounting Systems Analyst, you will be a key contributor with a track record working with global, high tech companies. You will leverage your technical and project management skills to participate in cross-functional initiatives to enhance existing systems, scope and design new financial systems, and drive efficiency improvements in partnership experiences. Analysts on the Global Revenue Systems team collaborate with multiple teams to ensure that we have robust, scalable accounting, and reporting processes to support our accounting operations and deliver on external data requests.\n</p>\n\n\n<p>In this role, you will focus on executing our code based monthly accounting operations and implementing opportunities to optimize our operations through programmatic automations. You will bring excellent attention to detail with the ability to work well with other teams, provide outstanding customer service, and deliver on timelines. Additionally, you will partner with our accounting operations to provide timely reports and develop scalable automations for accounting and reporting processes. You will also work closely with other teams, such as Engineering, Tax, Compliance, and Statutory Reporting to manage financial risk, ensuring that partners can adhere to regulatory requirements.</p><p>The name Google came from &quot;googol,&quot; a mathematical term for the number 1 followed by 100 zeros. And nobody at Google loves big numbers like the Finance team when providing in depth analysis on all manner of strategic decisions across Google products. From developing forward-thinking analysis to generating management reports to scaling our automated financial processes, the Finance organization is an important partner and advisor to the business.</p>",
