    "description": "<p>UX Engineers are the synthesis of design and development. They take Google&#39;s most innovative product concepts and bring them to life in an effort to push the boundaries of user interface design. Google is known for its design aesthetic and technical know-how. In a UX Engineer job, you&#39;ll need both types of skills to develop the next generation of products. You&#39;ll partner with Researchers and Designers to define and deliver new features, test new concepts and assist with final implementation. Details are critical as you iterate on complex interactions, animations and pixel-perfect visual designs.</p>\n\n<p>Our team has an ambitious vision: to build applications that enable people to seamlessly collaborate and accomplish complex tasks together. We\u2019re on a mission to build apps that will be a refreshing change from products and tools that companies so readily accept.\n</p>\n\n<p>As a UX Engineer Manager, you will work on the front end of our products and the features used our customers. The work is challenging, fast paced and always changing.</p><p>User experience (UX) is at the forefront of how we create intuitive, innovative, and beautiful products that people love. We strive to learn and understand our users\u2019 needs, behaviors, and emotions to yield insights that inform product strategy and guide the design of the experiences we create. Our multidisciplinary UX teams include designers, researchers, content strategists, and engineers who are passionate about quality, usability, and performance. We collaborate closely with product managers, software engineers, and many others to solve complex challenges and craft powerful experiences that highlight our products\u2019 unique capabilities and personalities.
