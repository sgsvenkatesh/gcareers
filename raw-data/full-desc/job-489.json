    "description": "<p>UX Engineers are the synthesis of design and development. They take Google&#39;s most innovative product concepts and bring them to life in an effort to push the boundaries of user interface design. Google is known for its design aesthetic and technical know-how. In a UX Engineer job, you&#39;ll need both types of skills to develop the next generation of products. You&#39;ll partner with Researchers and Designers to define and deliver new features, test new concepts and assist with final implementation. Details are critical as you iterate on complex interactions, animations and pixel-perfect visual designs.</p><p>User experience (UX) is at the forefront of how we create intuitive, innovative, and beautiful products that people love. We strive to learn and understand our users\u2019 needs, behaviors, and emotions to yield insights that inform product strategy and guide the design of the experiences we create. Our multidisciplinary UX teams include designers, researchers, content strategists, and engineers who are passionate about quality, usability, and performance. We collaborate closely with product managers, software engineers, and many others to solve complex challenges and craft powerful experiences that highlight our products\u2019 unique capabilities and personalities. Our work touches billions while exemplifying a key principle that is core to Google\u2019s philosophy: \u201cFocus on the user and all else will follow.\u201d</p>",
