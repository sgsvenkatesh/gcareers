    "description": "<p>YouTube\u2019s Product Partnerships team accelerates the global growth and innovation of YouTube products by driving new business opportunities through partnerships. We own the business side of new features, products and initiatives that are vital to the success of YouTube. As a team member, you understand the landscape of partnerships opportunities across technology licensing/integrations, marketing, and distribution. You will also craft strategies, define and structure critical partnerships, negotiate agreements, and cultivate our relationships.</p> <p>The spread of misinformation online and its implications for society are at the fore of public discourse. The Responsibility team works to prevent the spread of misinformation and safeguard the YouTube experience by enhancing our technology and user experiences. You\u2019ll work closely with Product to identify partnership opportunities that, for example, help empower users with information and context around critical, and often controversial, issues. You\u2019re excited by this team\u2019s mission and ready to bring your perspective and creativity to this challenging and ever-evolving area. You\u2019re as comfortable discussing with Product how a partner plugs into our technical workflows as you are diving into its implications with Legal and Policy. You are thoughtful, strategic, analytically driven, and possess a global perspective. You thrive in a fast-paced, ever-evolving, team-oriented environment.</p><p>At YouTube, we believe that everyone deserves to have a voice, and that the world is a better place when we listen, share, and build community through our stories. We work together to give everyone the power to share their story, explore what they love, and connect with one another in the process. Working at the intersection of cutting-edge technology and boundless creativity, we move at the speed of culture with a shared goal to show people the world. We explore new ideas, solve real problems, and have fun \u2014 and we do it all together.</p>",
