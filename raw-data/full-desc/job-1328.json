    "description": "<p>Google&#39;s projects, like our users, span the globe and require managers to keep the big picture in focus while being able to dive into the unique engineering challenges we face daily. As a Technical Program Manager at Google, you lead complex, multi-disciplinary engineering projects using your engineering expertise. You plan requirements with internal customers and usher projects through the entire project lifecycle. This includes managing project schedules, identifying risks and clearly communicating them to project stakeholders. You&#39;re equally at home explaining your team&#39;s analyses and recommendations to executives as you are discussing the technical trade-offs in product development with engineers.</p>\n\n\n<p>As an Architecture Technical Program Manager, you&#39;ll be a key member of the hardware engineering team that brings new hardware products to production. You will coordinate internal and external teams to influence, manage, and execute the product roadmap to align with Google\u2019s.\n</p>\n\n\n<p>In this role, you will work closely with hardware and software engineers and architects, global supply managers, operations and quality, and suppliers to deliver architecture specs, early hardware and software development, and evaluate criteria aligning with the roadmap and executive vision. You will coordinate moving parts with excellent communication skills and serve as the point of contact for questions about the state of the programs, including risks and associated mitigation options. Additionally, you will identify and manage risks with excellent judgment, deciding when is the right time to escalate.</p><p>Google&#39;s mission is to organize the world&#39;s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Our Hardware team researches, designs, and develops new technologies and hardware to make our user&#39;s interaction with computing faster, more powerful, and seamless. Whether finding new ways to capture and sense the world around us, advancing form factors, or improving interaction methods, our Hardware team is making people&#39;s lives better through technology.</p>",
