    "description": "<p>As Google drives toward audacious goals, we rely on our SEC Reporting and Technical Accounting team to know exactly what that growth looks like. Each month, quarter and year end, the team prepares the release of Google&#39;s financial statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the public. Through your relationships with various internal sources, you efficiently gather financial information and oversee the process of preparing, reviewing, submitting and distributing the financial reports. But this role calls for more than just knowing the books -- you also provide equity and treasury research and analysis and review necessary statutory reports. You give expert advice to senior management on U.S. GAAP and SEC filings, and work closely with the Investor Relations team on sales and earnings press releases and reports that reach securities analysts, investors and industry groups globally.</p>\n<p>You will enable Alphabet\u2019s growth by providing technical accounting clarity on complex matters through expertise, partnership, and thought-leadership.</p><p>The name Google came from &quot;googol,&quot; a mathematical term for the number 1 followed by 100 zeros. And nobody at Google loves big numbers like the Finance team when providing in depth analysis on all manner of strategic decisions across Google products. From developing forward-thinking analysis to generating management reports to scaling our automated financial processes, the Finance organization is an important partner and advisor to the business.</p>",
