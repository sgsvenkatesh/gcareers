    "description": "<p>Google&#39;s projects, like our users, span the globe and require managers to keep the big picture in focus while being able to dive into the unique engineering challenges we face daily. As a Technical Program Manager at Google, you lead complex, multi-disciplinary engineering projects using your engineering expertise. You plan requirements with internal customers and usher projects through the entire project lifecycle. This includes managing project schedules, identifying risks and clearly communicating them to project stakeholders. You&#39;re equally at home explaining your team&#39;s analyses and recommendations to executives as you are discussing the technical trade-offs in product development with engineers.</p><p>The YouTube Video Infrastructure team is the backbone of the video platform, leading innovations in audio/video quality, video processing, content delivery, and player features across Google. Our work brings to life innovative new features and improved experiences for our users at a global scale (e.g. 4K, VR, HFR, HDR), and power top YouTube initiatives including Music, Gaming, Live, and YouTube TV. We manage challenges that include how to scale our infrastructure to the continued massive growth of YouTube traffic, leading industry-wide initiatives in next generation codec/compression technology, identifying customized improvements to the watch experience for lower-bandwidth emerging markets, and optimizing the capabilities of the core player to directly improve the user viewing experience (such as lower rebuffers, higher quality, and quicker start times). </p><p>As a Video Infrastructure Technical Program Manager, you define, organize, and lead priority engineering initiatives that involve close collaboration within the Video Infrastructure Engineering organization, and across other Google Engineering teams and product areas.</p><p>At YouTube, we believe that everyone deserves to have a voice, and that the world is a better place when we listen, share, and build community through our stories. We work together to give everyone the power to share their story, explore what they love, and connect with one another in the process. Working at the intersection of cutting-edge technology and boundless creativity, we move at the speed of culture with a shared goal to show people the world. We explore new ideas, solve real problems, and have fun \u2014 and we do it all together.</p>",
