The goal of the residency is to help residents become productive and successful AI researchers.</p>\n\n<p>As part of this program, Residents collaborate with distinguished scientists from various <a href=\"https://ai.google/research/teams/\">Google AI</a> teams working on machine learning applications and problems. Residents have the opportunity to do everything from conducting fundamental research to contributing to products and services used by billions of people. We also encourage our Residents to publish their work externally. <a href=\"https://ai.google/research/pubs/?collection=ai-residency/\">Take a look</a> at the impactful research done by earlier cohorts.</p>\n\n\n<p><b>Please note that by applying to this job, you may be considered for all of the locations: </b><a href=\"https://careers.google.com/jobs#!t=jo&amp;jid=/google/google-ai-resident-2019-start-fixed-term-1600-amphitheatre-pkwy-mountain-view-ca-4482120160&amp;\">Bay Area (Mountain View and San Francisco</a>), <a href=\"https://careers.google.com/jobs#!t=jo&amp;jid=/google/google-ai-resident-2019-start-fixed-term-76-9th-ave-new-york-ny-10011-usa-4438890681&amp;\">New York City</a>, <a href=\"https://careers.google.com/jobs#!t=jo&amp;jid=/google/google-ai-resident-2019-start-fixed-term-355-main-st-cambridge-ma-02142-usa-4428680543&amp;\">Cambridge (Massachusetts)</a>, <a href=\"https://careers.google.com/jobs#!t=jo&amp;jid=/google/google-ai-resident-2019-start-fixed-term-1253-avenue-mcgill-college-montr%C3%A9al-qc-4432600826&amp;\">Montreal</a> and <a href=\"https://careers.google.com/jobs#!t=jo&amp;jid=/google/google-ai-resident-2019-start-fixed-term-111-richmond-st-w-toronto-on-m5h-2g4-4449840128&amp;\">Toronto</a>, Canada, <a href=\"https://careers.google.com/jobs#!t=jo&amp;jid=/google/google-ai-resident-2019-start-fixed-term-google-building-parkview-601-n-34th-st-4446050663&amp;\">Seattle (Washington State)</a>, <a href=\"https://careers.google.com/jobs#!t=jo&amp;jid=/google/google-ai-resident-2019-start-fixed-term-accra-ghana-4423140666&amp;\">Accra (Ghana)</a>, <a href=\"https://careers.google.com/jobs#!t=jo&amp;jid=/google/google-ai-resident-2019-start-fixed-term-yigal-alon-st-98-tel-aviv-yafo-israel-4438210683&amp;\">Tel Aviv (Israel)</a> and <a href=\"https://careers.google.com/jobs#!t=jo&amp;jid=/google/google-ai-resident-2019-start-fixed-term-google-building-110-brandschenkestrasse-4437810341&amp;\">Zurich (Switzerland)</a>. Residents are placed based on interest, project fit, location preference and team needs. All are expected to work on site.</p>\n\n<p>We encourage candidates from all over the world to apply. You may have research experience in another field (e.g. human-computer interaction, mathematics, physics, bioinformatics, etc.) and want to apply machine learning to this area, or have limited research experience but a strong desire to learn more. Current students will need to graduate from their degree program (BS/MS/PhD) before the residency begins. If a candidate requires work authorization for a location, Google will explore the available options on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n\n<p>Your application should show evidence of proficiency in programming and in prerequisite courses (e.g., machine learning, user-centered interfaces or applications, data science, mathematical analysis). This can be demonstrated through links to open-source projects, notable performances in competitions, publications and blog posts, or projects that showcase implementation of one or more novel learning algorithms.</p><p>There is always more information out there, and the Research and Machine Intelligence team has a never-ending quest to find it and make it accessible. We&#39;re constantly refining our signature search engine to provide better results, and developing offerings like Google Instant, Google Voice Search and Google Image Search to make it faster and more engaging. We&#39;re providing users around the world with great search results every day, but at Google, great just isn&#39;t good enough. We&#39;re just getting started.</p>",
