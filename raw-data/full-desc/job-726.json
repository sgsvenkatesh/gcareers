    "description": "<p>People Ops is always looking to make the experience of work better and more meaningful for Googlers. But innovating (and operating!) is increasingly complex when Googlers work in more than 50 countries, each with its own unique practices and regulations. The Diversity, Integrity &amp; Governance team works to make sure we not only do what\u2019s required by law, but that we continue to raise the bar and do what\u2019s right for Googlers all over the globe. From supporting LGBT rights to extending parental leave benefits, we aspire to do the right thing in every part of the world: to be fair and inclusive, disciplined but not rigid, and consistent but not bureaucratic.</p>\n\n<p>Equity, Diversity, Inclusion and Integrity (EDII) Business Partners operate as trusted advisors, embedded deeply in the business, who consult on the needs of the organization and design relevant solutions. You will work closely with executives, business partners and People Operations partners to provide thought leadership, manage the business relationship, and set and execute on initiatives to help the business make progress to diversity and inclusion goals. You are the face of the EDII team to the business, cascading EDII products and services to the business and identifying your client\u2019s unique needs to effectively customize.</p><p>Great just isn&#39;t good enough for our People Operations team (you probably know us better as &quot;\u0098Human Resources&quot;). Made up of equal parts HR professionals, former consultants and analysts, we&#39;re the champions of Google&#39;s colorful culture. In People Ops, we &quot;find them, grow them, and keep them&quot;\u009d - we bring the world&#39;s most innovative people to Google and provide the programs that help them thrive. Whether recruiting the next great Googler, refining our core programs, developing talent or simply looking for ways to inject some more fun into the lives of our Googlers, we bring a data-driven approach that is reinventing the human resources field.</p>",
