Python scripts to generate insights on tech trends at Google North America.  
_Thanks to [Hemanth Malla](https://github.com/hemanthmalla) for the idea._

This repository is aimed to get an overview of the tech skills that Google is looking for. The scripts crawl the [Google Careers website](https://careers.google.com/jobs/results/?company=Google&company=YouTube&employment_type=FULL_TIME&hl=en_US&jlo=en_US&q=&sort_by=relevance) and counts of frequency of the keywords listed at [tech-list.json](https://github.com/sgsvenkatesh/gcareers/blob/master/tech-list.json) on the Google Careers website. 

Below is a short description of the functionality of each of the files.

`__init__.py` gives an overview of the flow and the order in which the files are executed. You may use this a module if needed.  
`crawl_list.py` fetches all the jobs listed at Google and YouTube  
`crawl_full_desc.py` fetches full job description for each of the job listing from the previous step  
`get_stats.py` sanitizes the crawled descriptions and counts the frequency of words of lengths 1, 2 and 3. Stores the results at `./results/`.  
`clustering.py` finds the occurence of each of the skills mentioned at [tech-list.json](https://github.com/sgsvenkatesh/gcareers/blob/master/tech-list.json) in the results obtained from previous step. Stores the results at `./results/analytics/`.

### Results

Below are the results we got on analyzing over 2200 job descriptions, as we found on _19th March 2019_.

### Takeaways

* As you would be expecting, Cloud-related skills seem to be in great demand, with a whopping count of ~4700. Further to this, Security, Networks, Mobile, Search seem to be the most sought out fields at Google. 
* It was interesting to see that there are negligible or no occurences of popular topics like Quantum Computing and BioInformatics. 
* Besides this, keywords like Computer Vision, Computer Architecture, Cryptography, Virtualization, Compilers, E-commerce Devops, Internet of Things, BlockChain have really low number of occurences compared to that of Cloud, Search and others.
* Also, Algorithms & Data Structures keywords were observed to occur only ~350 times. From the above data, it appears to me that being able to [invert a binary tree](https://twitter.com/mxcl/status/608682016205344768?lang=en) may not be as important to Google today as it is at excelling in one field.
